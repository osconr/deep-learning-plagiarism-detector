problem-136.txt,1,2,"I would go with Fiber, there is the possibility that in the future we might hit a dead end in how much speed can be had from copper. I mean twisted pair is as old as the telephone, now sure that means that it has had plenty of time to mature, but there exists the possibility of multiple colors running on the same fiber.","Most of the key issues have been mentioned - Fiber is easier to handle, weighs less, makes for a much neater environment and has better range (generally). As LapTop006 mentioned one consequence of this is that the port density on switches is generally higher for fiber, you'll find that many modular switches support a higher SFP+ port count than either CX4 (Twin-AX) or 10GBase-T (STP)."

That may not be of significance if you are only connecting up a few links but if you are building out a significant infrastructure then this may be something you need to pay attention to.

You could also have a look at Generalized models which extend linear regresssion to cases where the variable to predict is only positive (Gamma regression) or between 0 and 1 (logistic regression). If you are predicting a categorical variable, you could also perform one hot encoding and transform your regression problem in a classification. Last but not least, as suggested in the last question it might be interesting to normalise your output between 0 and 1 and have a logistic regression in the last layer. Hope this help "

problem-44.txt,1,1,"If you have access to shaders, you can invert the drawing logic. Normally you loop through tiles and draw each one. When you're zoomed out there are a lot of tiles to draw. Zooming out is slower. Inverting the logic, you can loop through pixels and figure out which tile that pixel is on, and that tells you which sprite to draw, and then you look up a color in the sprite. This is weird but it means that no matter what zoom level, you have the same number of draw calls (just one quad), and the same amount of work to do, at least for the tiles. The objects on top of the map don't work with this trick so you'll still have to draw them separately.","To make it work you put the game map into a texture. The texture color tells you which tile to use. You also have the tile sprites in another texture. For example if you have 32x32 pixel tiles, and 16x16 of them, you can put that into a 512x512 texture. If the game map is 200x200 you can put that into a 200x200 texture, where each color is {red = 0.0 for column 0 to red = 1.0 for column 15, green = 0.0 for row 0 to 1.0 to row 15}. "

You would need to use standalone network endpoint groups(NEG). Create load balancer manually (or with whatever tooling you use), create backend service that includes NEGs for the same service in different clusters and add backend service to the load balancer.

RTT of a DNS query is the measurement of the delay between a DNS query being issued and the time the answer is received, meaning that the reply (in your case - reply to #1 received from A) must arrive before the configured maximum timeout in order for it to be considered valid. It's quite identical to how ICMP works.

The two peices of hardware are directly connected and the nvidia controle panel can get the information about your monitor from the GPU directly through the Nvidia graphics driver bypassing the Monitor driver all to gether. Your monitor has a hardware id and so does your graphics card. Plug and play hardware like a monitor transmits its hardware id through its connection. DP and HDMI are data conections all be it high bandwidth specialized for video they are still data connections. It is critical for monitor opperation for the GPU and monitor to be able to comunicate on more than a one way color transmission or for instance features like vsync would not work. That is why the Nvidia driver and GPU can recognise 10 bit + capability and allow the apropriate setting to be availble even when windows fails. The problem is  simply Windows and the lack of support for hardware from microsoft. This is also microsoft thinking your to stupid to know you have a 10 bit display and assuming if they let you control the setting you will brake the display, crash the driver or have a bad experiance and in turn blame Windows aka the product.

problem-270.txt,1,1,"Linux supports virtual memory, that is, using a disk as an extension of RAM so that the effective size of usable memory grows correspondingly. The kernel will write the contents of a currently unused block of memory to the hard disk so that the memory can be used for another purpose.

This is all made completely transparent to the user; programs running under Linux only see the larger amount of memory available and don't notice that parts of them reside on the disk from time to time. Of course, reading and writing the hard disk is slower (on the order of a thousand times slower) than using real memory, so the programs don't run as fast.

I recently installed new graphics drivers for Ubuntu and I suspect that my graphics drivers for Windows 10 were deleted during this process. Is there any way for me to reinstall graphics drivers when I cannot see the screen, or possibly install into the Windows partition through Ubuntu? Graphics card is an RTX 2080. I have tried booting into Safe Mode, but the result is the same, with the addition of a non-functional flashing taskbar."
problem-113.txt,1,1,The goal of persistance is to allow you to keep the content of one folder (for instance /home) across reboots. You cannot have persistance on the whole system because it is stored in an ISO file that gets loaded when you boot. ,"What you are looking for is to do a full install of Kali on USB stick.

","Actually I've noticed two folders appear on the persistent partition, 'rw' and 'work'. It seems that a properly placed persistence.conf file (with the contents '/ union' causes this. The commands you mentioned do this from the command line, but it doesn't matter how you get it there. All the updates and downloads you add and perform after this, while booted into live USB w/ persistence from grub, will appear in the rw folder. I suspect the work folder to be a place holder for an additional encrypted partition, but have found precious little documentation on setting this up and creating the proper entry in grub to boot into it, or how it is supposed to 'work'... I don't usually require that level of security. For basic USB persistence while live booting, the key is placing that text file in the root of the 3rd partition. The rest should be automatically handled by the os"
