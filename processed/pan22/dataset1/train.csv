problem-678.txt,1,2,"Really, if you just add another router and connect the Ethernet cable to its Internet port, then it would allow the speakers to run.  If that doesn't seem viable to you then many SBC (Single-Board Computer) type systems can probably fill you request fairly well.  Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Olimex, as well as many others would be good candidates so long as they have both a LAN port and WiFi capabilities.  Dual or even Single WiFi might work, but you'd have to do more of a set up to get it to work right, (one WiFi for your University connection, one for your speakers).  Spotify runs on Linux, and many of the SBC systems come with some form of Linux, so you should be set there.  I don't know what system requirements are needed for Spotify on Linux, but I should think that at lest 512M-1G should suite your needs, (I'd lean towards the 1G-2G systems just to be safe).

A better solution is to create a saner hybrid MBR on the disk.

Examples are a internet server you connect to with your internet browser as client or a Secure SHell Daemon (sshd) you connect to with ssh or scp as client or a NFS server resp. Samba server that provide network shares you can connect to e.g. with the mount program as client and use as normal directories to read and write data.

Provider B connects through three other local providers and does not have a server or device in the continental US that I can use for the test.

Initially the website would return error 500 from the server when trying to upload something bigger, like ~50MB. I Googled up that IIS requires configuration of maxAllowedContentLength (changed default to 209715200, ~300MB) and FastCGI's parameters for IDLE, ACTIVITY and REQUEST (changed to 600) in order to allow bigger files upload without hitting the file size limit. However, now that the files are getting uploaded, the upload speed for these bigger files slowed down to a crawl.

Not a linear increase I would expect.","When I inspect task Manager on IIS while upload is on-going, I can see in Performance->Ethernet tab that for smaller files (e.g. 11MB) ""receive"" value keeps high at like 24Mbps, but when I try to upload a big file, this value drops down from an initially high value to like 2-4 Mbps.

To see that, just take the set system, and build a bipartite graph, with ground elements on one side, and sets on the other side. Connect every set, to every element it covers. All edges have weight 1, and all missing edges, are assigned their shortest path distance. Clearly, in this graph, there is a coverage by k balls (of radius 1) of m points iff there are k sets covering m elements in the original set system. since 1-1/e approximation to partial set cover is the best one can hope for (I am too lazy to find the ref - but that should be well known), it follows that it is not possible in general to do better."

problem-83.txt,1,2,More information available here - Wikipedia: Linear Interpolation,So I am making a first person networked shooter.  I am working on client-side prediction where I am predicting player position and look vectors client-side based on input messages received from the server.  Right now I am only worried about the look vectors though.  I am receiving the correct look vector from the server about 20 times per second and I am checking that against the look vector that I have client side.  I want to interpolate the clients look vector towards the correct one that is server side over a period of time.  Therefore no matter how far you are away from the servers look vector you will interpolate to it over the same amount of time.  Ex. if you were 10 degrees off it would take the same amount of time as if you were 2 degrees off to be correctly lined up with the server copy.  My code looks something like this but the problem is that the amount that you are changing the clients copy gets infinitesimally small so you will actually never reach the servers copy.  This is because I am always calculating the difference and only moving by a percentage of that every frame.  Does anyone have any suggestions on how to interpolate towards the servers copy correctly?

problem-964.txt,1,2,"Depending on what model you are using, the way things are multiplied and added together at prediction time slightly varies, but in principal it's all the same.  You train a model that tries to learn the relationship of the feature vectors you give it to the associated targets.  At prediction time, the same mathematical operations are being applied to every input you are trying to make a prediction for.  So, the weights you learned during the training phase represent the feature importance across the entire training set, in which you hope generalizes to unseen ""test"" data.  If you suspect that there are other reasons behind why an employee decided to resign outside of what the model weights are telling you, this would indicate that your model does not have enough features to separate the two classes of ""not resign"" vs. ""resign"".  Essentially, during testing time, the feature importance is static and the exact same across any input you give.  If feature1 is the most important for input 1, its the most important for every input.  This is what the model learned.      ","I know my question might look odd but I just wanted to get some insights. Every prediction model will give us predictions for validation data set and it also can give/rank features based on their weight on predictions. I am looking for one step after that. Lets say we are dealing with employee resignation and we know the most important features are pay, latest promotion, job satisfaction and external job opportunities around that employees residence. Now, is there any way that we can say which of these features is the most important feature for an individual prediction? May be for one employee, Job satisfaction is the reason behind the leave but based on our feature importance, we need to focus on pay first. I just wanted to know if there is anyway that we can do some post processing on each individual predictions?"

Adhering to 3NF is desirable but not always practical.

First, you are unlikely to have a great deal of redundant data, unless you have many staff/clients living at the same addresses.  Secondly, modification anomalies are not really going to be important to you:  Sure, if you delete the only record for a person with a specific postal code, you will lose the facts that 1) such a postal code exists, and 2) exactly to which address that postal code refers; but neither of these facts is important to your system.

problem-1216.txt,1,1,A DMZ is just a network design term that means that the network is firewalled in a way that it can not initiate traffic into a protected network.  There isn't anything special about the port or that network for that matter.  Although a port that's marked as DMZ from the firewall's software point of view may have different default firewall rule applied to it.,I don't know about the 50b but with the 60b you can unbridge all the internal ports and run different networks on each port.  The firewall rules and all the other features of the FortiGate work fine between these networks.  I used this approach to have multiple DMZs using a FortiGate 60b a couple years back.

Feige-Hajiaghayi-Lee at the same time obtained a similar bound again via ARV for vertex separators (and also pointed out that treewidth can be approximated within the same factor). One should note that there is another notion of sparsest cut in directed graphs for which Chuzhoy-Khanna showed hardness results in the non-uniform case but I am not sure about the uniform case.

problem-270.txt,1,1,"There's a very succinct diagram showing how three separate source\user signal pairs can be carried on a single medium in this National Instruments page. Fundamentally each individual channel is allocated a frequency band, with each set of bands occupying separate chunks of the RF spectrum. Because of this they can all be carried on the same shared medium at the same time and the band pass filters at the receiving end allow them to be separated. The same principle applies whatever frequency range or media you want to use. There are many ways to implement this so if you are interested in how it works at the physical level for something in particular then you will have to be a lot more specific.",As far as putting these channels to use and carrying signals\data there are quite a few variations in technique depending on how the signal itself is carried within the band assigned to the carrier - the Wikipedia article that Scott linked to is as good a place as any to to start digging into those.

Each of those regions is independent and makes its own policies. Some (e.g. ARIN) decided to immediately use up all addresses, others decided to reserve some addresses so that new internet companies still have a chance to connect to the IPv4 internet without having to buy or rent addresses from others.
