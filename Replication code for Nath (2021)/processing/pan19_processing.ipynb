But it makes sense (and if someone knows of a good refutation, I'd like to read it), especially in light of your question. So, you either believe this or you don't because not only does Islam have the same roots as Judaism and Christianity, Muslims truly worship the same one God (from a philosophical standpoint, if there's only one, it's gotta be Him right?).\n",

      "But, they're not the most important part.  I don't know what the most important part of a protestant service is, but the most important part of the Catholic Mass is in the Liturgy of the Eucharist, not the Liturgy of the Word (which the homily is a part of) and that part, unless some profoundly illicit thing is happening, should have equal awesomeness wherever you go.\n",

      "My poor understanding of Platonism, as a philosophy of mathematics, is that there is a common universe composed of pure thought, representing a collection of idealized objects, about which people can reason and discover (not invent!) new relationships and previously unconceived objects.  For example, any arrangement of perfect spheres that can be imagined exists in this universe.  By discussion, one \"projects\" these idealisations into our real universe to model our perceptions of what (barring solipsism, we presume) is our common reality.\n",
      "I mention this because I see model theory as an applied form of Platonism in the small. When one decides to work with a definable piece of the idealized universe one can specify the domain of objects and the allowed basic operations and relations and then work through or deduce all the desired or at least conceptually feasible combinations and arrangements of these.  In particular, if you have a theory T and a statement q in the same language that is independent of T, then T with q is another theory, and since q was independent of T, both T and T with q are theories that share a model. However, if we pick p and q, both can be individually independent from T, but p and q may separately restrict the collection of models into two disjoint parts, and there may be no model shared by T and p and by T and q.  So it is possible (and likely) that Plato(T) does not have a model, as Plato(T) may include  both statements p and q.  You may feel sure that RH and Goldbach both have the natural numbers (and other structures) as a model; I am not so confident.  Put another way, I have my reason for believing that it is possible there is no such model.\n",
      "I am rusty on the technical detail, but I believe there is something like the Lindenbaum algebra (LA) for realizable types inside a given first order language L, that one element of this (thing which resembles a Boolean) algebra represents (up to logical equivalence or some other equivalence) the given axioms for some effective theory T of which the natural numbers is a model, that there are a continuum of elements which represent completions (or extensions) of T, and that only one of them is Nat(T), the complete first-order theory of the natural numbers.  There are many members which represent large subsets of Plato(T), but I am not convinced that there is even one member that represents T with p and q, with T a standard effective first-order axiomatization of the naturals, p an appropriate equivalent version of the Riemann hypothesis, and q an equivalent version of Goldbach.\n",
      "In addition to (whatever it is that corresponds to Lindenbaum algebras that escapes me for realizing types), there is the notion of prime model, which gets at part of your post and says something like \"if there is a sentence p of a special form which is independent of T, then p must be true in the naturals because the naturals are a prime model of T\". Since you are using ZFC for one part of your post and the natural numbers (whose theories are expressed using a different language and axiom system, say first order Peano Arithmetic) in another part, people may conflate the two and assume the naturals are a prime model for ZFC: the naturals are a prime model for (a version of) PA, not for ZFC.  To get at your notion properly ( as well as the LA notion above), one needs to fix a first order language and recast RH and GC into appropriate versions in that language, and consider things modulo logical equivalence.

Thus for the subsets Bi associated to the members Bi2 of the clique partition A2, you get to decide whether disjoint Bi and Bj belong to the same or to different P in K.  This is a kind of packing problem since you have to decide how to pack the different pieces into different bags.

AT this load, the solar panels could not produce enough power in full sun to keep this running.  Nevermind cloudy days, inverter efficiency, etc.  Perhaps you could double the solar setup.\n",

      "You will want to use an automatic continuous/servo mode to photograph birds in flight (BIF). Most modern cameras support some kind of servo mode, even entry-level cameras. Using servo mode is only part of the solution to tracking BIF, however. More advanced cameras offer additional AF features, such as multipoint AF Expansion or Zone AF that will use more than one focus point around your key selected point. The use of an AF Expansion/Zone AF mode will improve your tracking ability over the use of a single point. Tracking ability is often dependent on the AF system used, and if you have the option, using a system with more and denser points, particularly those with configurable zones, will improve your ability to track subjects.\n",
      "Additionally, a denser AF system, such as the newer reticular 51-pt Nikon and 61-pt Canon, offer more points that are more closely spaced together which can greatly assist in subject lock and continuous tracking. Most Canon cameras have a 9-pt AF system that is not reticular, and there is quite a bit of space between each point. The Canon 7D uses a 19-pt AF system that is not reticular, but definitely denser than the standard 9-pt system, and every point is a high precision cross-type point which can identify and lock subjects much more quickly. Canon's 19-pt AF system supports Expansion and Zone AF modes. Canon's newest AF system is their 61-pt AF system with 41 cross-type points in a reticular design. This AF system is currently only found on the 1D X and 5D III bodies, however it is the most advanced AF system available at the current time. It supports full multi-dimensional tracking (frame position, distance, RGB color information), multiple types of zone and expansion AF modes, as well as spot AF (smaller area single-point AF, which can be useful for focusing on very precise locations...say a birds eye). Canon's 61pt system is also the first to offer 5 center double-cross type AF points with ultra high precision for extremely fast focusing.\n",
      "In Nikon systems, there are 11-pt and 39-pt AF systems in lower-end bodies. The 11-pt systems are roughly similar to Canon 9-pt systems, however their 39-pt system is more of a reticular design. It offers 9 cross-type high precision points around the center. All Nikon AF systems support what they call \"3D Tracking\", which simply means they use frame position, distance, and color information to help inform the AF system of where the subject is likely to be in the next frame, supporting advanced tracking. To use 3D tracking, you must use all 39 points, which is actually less effective than it may sound (more in a bit). Nikon's latest AF system is their new 51-pt, which is also a reticular design. It supports some semblance of Zone AF, although it only works around the center point. The strength of Nikon's system is multi-point f/8 AF...up to 11 points with a single center cross type and 10 surrounding line sensors. This can be a bonus if you intend to use lenses with teleconverters that reduce the maximum aperture to f/8 (i.e. a 600mm f/4 lens with a 2x TC for 1200mm.) \n",
      "I believe this mark is intended to indicate 28mm (just zoom to the dot and take a photo, you should see 28mm in EXIF.) In general, I think the mark is also intended to indicate the point of least extension (based on anecdotal evidence I have from using three of the pictured lenses), however there does appear to be some variation, with least extension occurring between 27mm and 31mm.  \n",
      "Exposure compensation is just another means of changing either shutter or aperture. I is not some fourth component of exposure, there are still only three: ISO, Shutter Speed, Aperture. If you have manually selected an aperture, changing EC will reduce shutter speed. If you have manually selected a shutter speed, changing EV will increase the size of the aperture, unless it's already at max.\n",
      "ISO 300 is NOTHING. Cameras these days can easily be used at ISO 1600 or even 3200 without serious problems with noise. I think your being much too critical of noise, and I think your severely hurting yourself by forcing the use of ultra wide apertures or ultra slow shutter speeds, both of which can affect IQ in ways that cannot really be fixed in post. Noise is predictable, and therefor easy to reduce and clean up in post. A thin depth of field, however, cannot be fixed in post...if you end up with too much of your scene out of focus because you used the maximum aperture, your simply stuck with too much of your scene out of focus. If you end up with motion blur or camera shake blur, then your image is simply blurry.\n",
      "When it comes to deciding which tradeoff to make, you should generally make the tradeoff of more noise first, then move to a wider aperture or a slower shutter speed as a last resort. I would also make sure you fully understand what exposure compensation is and what it's doing. EC isn't some fourth option for changing exposure...it is simply an alternative means of changing shutter speed or aperture. If you select maximum aperture and an ISO setting, then using EC to increase exposure means your exposure time (shutter speed) is getting longer. That means you run an increased risk of blurring the scene because of shaky hands or subject motion.\n",
      "Noise, as much as it is demonized these days by photographers, is one of the more manageable artifacts in digital images. Don't fear it...at least, not as much as you do. ISO 300 is VERY, VERY LOW. You should be pushing ISO 800 or 1600 before you really start worrying about noise. With a good camera (modern APS-C DSLR at least), you should be able to use ISO 1600 without fear, and FF DSLRs like the 6D can be used at ISO 6400 or higher. For compacts, many use very advanced processing for JPEGS, making ISO 1600, 3200, and sometimes even higher very viable options. Looks pretty dull. ISO 3200 at 30 seconds. This was actually photographed under dark skies, and you can see the bubble of light pollution from a big city to the south in the lower right corner. Stopped the aperture down a little bit to sharpen stars. This is the winter milky way, part of the arms of our galaxy, so it is much dimmer than the summer part of the milky way which includes the core. \n",
      "With some processing in Lightroom, I was able to come up with this: The blur circle size is 9.6 microns. In terms of spatial resolution in units of line pairs per millimeter, that is: Reference: Two by Andy Mumford\n",
      "The full range of telephoto focal lengths can be useful for landscape, not just 200mm. Here is another example at 80mm:  \n",
      "The fundamental driver of cost in a lens is not the correction of aberrations, although the correction of aberrations does add to the cost of a lens, and may be a more significant factor in wider angle lenses. Generally speaking, the primary cost of a lens is the \"glass\". I put glass in quotes, because sometimes it is other materials, such as Fluorite or a diffraction grating or diffractive particle dispersion, however advanced lens elements usually cost MORE.\n",
      "You cannot achieve a specified aperture without having the appropriate magnification from both ends of the lens for that aperture to appear to be the correct size. The notion of a \"physical aperture\" is generally a misnomer. What we call the aperture of a lens, what is frequently referred to as the physical aperture, is correctly termed the entrance pupil. The entrance pupil is the aperture as observed through the front of the lens at a distance of \"infinity\" (or, in other words, a sufficiently great distance that the observation is of collimated light.) The entrance pupil of a 600mm lens with an f/4 relative aperture must be 150mm as observed through the front of the lens. To achieve that magnification, two things must be:  \n",
      "I took some shots of lightning last night. I did not have a great vantage point, so I used the time to experiment and learn. When it came to white balance, even with AWB set on my camera, the resulting scenes came out with considerable color cast. The clouds had a deep orange hue, partly due to the orange street lights that light up suburbia where I live. The lightning bolts themselves showed up with a vibrant purple hue.\n",
      "I spent some time in Lightroom trying to manually correct the color by manually setting the proper kelvin for lightning, however there is no one single correct value. After a little while I noticed a tool I had never noticed before...a dropper that lets you pick a pixel in your image that you wish to set as the 18% gray point. Using this tool, my photos instantly started looking correct. The clouds were a proper grayish tone, while the lightning bolts themselves came out to a brilliant, barely bluish, bright white.\n",
      "I am not sure if other tools have a tool that lets you select an area of your image to set as the 18% gray point, however if you do, it is by far the most accurate way to properly color balance lightning shots.\n",

      "The fundamental driver of cost in a lens is not the correction of aberrations, although the correction of aberrations does add to the cost of a lens, and may be a more significant factor in wider angle lenses. Generally speaking, the primary cost of a lens is the \"glass\". I put glass in quotes, because sometimes it is other materials, such as Fluorite or a diffraction grating or diffractive particle dispersion, however advanced lens elements usually cost MORE.\n",
      "You cannot achieve a specified aperture without having the appropriate magnification from both ends of the lens for that aperture to appear to be the correct size. The notion of a \"physical aperture\" is generally a misnomer. What we call the aperture of a lens, what is frequently referred to as the physical aperture, is correctly termed the entrance pupil. The entrance pupil is the aperture as observed through the front of the lens at a distance of \"infinity\" (or, in other words, a sufficiently great distance that the observation is of collimated light.) The entrance pupil of a 600mm lens with an f/4 relative aperture must be 150mm as observed through the front of the lens. To achieve that magnification, two things must be:  \n",

When it came to white balance, even with AWB set on my camera, the resulting scenes came out with considerable color cast. The clouds had a deep orange hue, partly due to the orange street lights that light up suburbia where I live. The lightning bolts themselves showed up with a vibrant purple hue.\n",
      "I spent some time in Lightroom trying to manually correct the color by manually setting the proper kelvin for lightning, however there is no one single correct value.

Using this tool, my photos instantly started looking correct. The clouds were a proper grayish tone, while the lightning bolts themselves came out to a brilliant, barely bluish, bright white.\n",

Iridium is more common in meteorites than it is in earth's crust, probably because it is so freaking dense any iridium on the planet is in a lump in the center of the core.  The high iridium content of the geologic layer at the end of the Cretaceous is what gave a hint that a meteoric impact might be involved.   Iridium is three times more dense than iron and three times as hard.

      "Bitcoin is unique in that only 21 million bitcoins will ever be created. However, this will never be a limitation because transactions can be denominated in smaller sub-units of a bitcoin, such as bits - there are 1,000,000 bits in 1 bitcoin. Bitcoins can be divided up to 8 decimal places (0.000 000 01) and potentially even smaller units if that is ever required in the future as the average transaction size decreases. The price of a bitcoin is determined by supply and demand. When demand for bitcoins increases, the price increases, and when demand falls, the price falls. There is only a limited number of bitcoins in circulation and new bitcoins are created at a predictable and decreasing rate, which means that demand must follow this level of inflation to keep the price stable. Because Bitcoin is still a relatively small market compared to what it could be, it doesn't take significant amounts of money to move the market price up or down, and thus the price of a bitcoin is still very volatile. From a user perspective, Bitcoin is nothing more than a mobile app or computer program that provides a personal Bitcoin wallet and allows a user to send and receive bitcoins with them. This is how Bitcoin works for most users.\n",
      "Behind the scenes, the Bitcoin network is sharing a public ledger called the \"block chain\". This ledger contains every transaction ever processed, allowing a user's computer to verify the validity of each transaction. The authenticity of each transaction is protected by digital signatures corresponding to the sending addresses, allowing all users to have full control over sending bitcoins from their own Bitcoin addresses. In addition, anyone can process transactions using the computing power of specialized hardware and earn a reward in bitcoins for this service. This is often called \"mining\". To learn more about Bitcoin, you can consult the dedicated page and the original paper. Much of the trust in Bitcoin comes from the fact that it requires no trust at all. Bitcoin is fully open-source and decentralized. This means that anyone has access to the entire source code at any time. Any developer in the world can therefore verify exactly how Bitcoin works. All transactions and bitcoins issued into existence can be transparently consulted in real-time by anyone. All payments can be made without reliance on a third party and the whole system is protected by heavily peer-reviewed cryptographic algorithms like those used for online banking. No organization or individual can control Bitcoin, and the network remains secure even if not all of its users can be trusted.\n",

The sky that night at 2pm when I went out to check some of my equipment was literally blue...like the pre-dawn twilight. It was so bright for a moment I wondered what the heck was...weird...then I realized I could see, clearly, even into the shadows. I suspect it was even be brighter last month than tonight unless a similar atmospheric phenomena occurs around 11pm tonight. Anyway...this demonstrates worst case scenario with the moon. And in the end, despite the additional light pollution, the data was still actually usable (I just under-weighted it relative to the rest of the data). \n",
      "I have created several deep sky images with a half moon in the sky. While the moon can introduce a slight color cast that can sometimes be difficult to work out, ultimately it does not affect the quality of the images as much as a full moon: \n",
      "The rest of the factors are pretty minor...price is highly subjective and time dependent (I picked up my 7D brand new for $1300 on Amazon, where as the D7000 currently lists on Amazon for $1499 new.) The number of available lenses tends to leapfrog periodically, as different brands release batches of new lenses on different years, and is pretty much a moot point anyway...your never going to own all 160 some lenses from either brand, and all the critical focal lengths, designs, and lens capabilities for the essential lenses are pretty much the same for both brands. Battery life is also a highly subjective thing, and entirely depends on how your using the camera. I've had anywhere from 400 shots to over 1000 shots on a single battery with my 7D, and well over 1500 with two batteries and the Zeikos grip (which is very reasonably priced.) Video features also tend to be somewhat subjective...and are generally moot if video is not something you are even concerned with in the first place. The Nikon's ability to AF during video is intriguing, but not that useful, given that the majority of serious cinematography done with DSLR's use a proper manual focus puller device for more accurate focus that is not prone to random hunting when AF can't find its mark.\n",
      "The snapsort comparison left out a few things as well. The 7D has an 8fps frame rate, vs. the D7000's 6fps. However, its more than just the frame rate difference...the 7D guarantees 8fps @ 14bit RAW with a 15-frame buffer, while the D7000 does 6fps @ 12bit RAW with an 11-frame buffer (I think it might do 14bit RAW as well with a shorter buffer...can't find any stats on that right now.) The added output bit depth is a nice bonus, but the greater frame buffer depth, along with the two extra frames per second, are truly significant when shooting action. If you don't shoot much action, then the benefits of the 7D will probably not be all that valuable to you, and sticking with the T2i might be your best option right now. \n",
      "The D4 is still a 14-bit RAW camera according to Nikon's own specifications page: \n",
      "It sounds like you are underexposing. Noise is generally a more significant problem when the brightest pixels in your image are only about 18% gray level. If this is the case on a consistent basis, especially if you are encountering blurring (I assume due to camera shake) then you are plain and simply using too low of an ISO setting. \n",
      "If you use a low ISO setting and under-expose, then boost that exposure in post, your actually amplifying the effects of noise a lot more than if you use a higher ISO setting. If you are getting blurry, noisy shots at ISO 400, try ISO 800 or even ISO 1600. The goal is to saturate your exposures, pushing the average per-pixel luminance beyond that 18% gray level. The more pixels you can saturate beyond an 18% gray level, the less noisy your image will appear. If you over-expose but do not blow out your highlights, you can recover exposure in post with a little negative exposure compensation or highlight recovery.\n",
      "The fear of using a \"high\" ISO setting is often the cause of noisy photos. High ISO is not bad, and in low-light situations (even with flash), you need to use the highest ISO setting you must as dictated by minimum shutter speed requirements. In general, the camera will do a better job of boosting exposure while minimizing noise when using higher ISO settings than you could generally do by shooting at a lower ISO setting and trying to compensate for underexposure in post.  Comparing what you see on screen to what you see in a print is not nearly as simple as it may sound. Aside from color (or more precisely, chromaticity), another key difference between gamuts is the white and black point. Similar to the differences in chromaticity between gmauts, the deepest black and the whitest white also differ in extent. This is particularly true when moving between gamuts based on fundamentally different color models, such as screen and print. \n",
      "A computer screen uses an additive model that blends light, and as such, a much purer black and brighter white point can be achieved. Print, on the other hand, is a subtractive model based on reflectivity of ink off a paper substrate, and as such, the purest white and purest black have distinct limitations. Namely, the brightest white and the temperature of white is specifically defined by the tone and color of the paper used. The purest black is defined by the particular blend of inks used to make black, and their density. Neither a paper substrate nor blend of inks can ever create a true, pure white or black, and will usually not reach the same extent as a computer screen.\n",
      "Soft proofing is the key mechanism by which you can normalize the differenced between gamuts in a way that preserves detail in the shadows and highlights. Lightroom currently does not offer any kind of soft proofing, however Photoshop does. With soft proofing, you can tell photoshop to render your image in such a way that it simulates the paper color, black point, and gamut of the printer, inks, and paper you intend to print on. When soft proofing mode is enabled, you will easily be able to see where your highlights and blacks bunch up and clip. An additional, complimentary mode will show you out of gamut colors. It is possible to edit an image while soft proofing, so white and black points, as well as out of gamut colors can be corrected for the particular device and paper you intend to print on. \n",
      "Correcting gamut errors with soft proofing is pretty strait forward. White and black points can easily be adjusted with the levels tool. You can either directly set the white and black point by pulling their respective markers in toward the center of the histogram a little bit, until your highlights and blacks no longer appear clipped. You might also need to adjust the midtone point to rebalance the image and maintain the proper degree of contrast. It should be noted that your scene may look, on screen, like it is lacking some contrast when soft proofing, and it may appear that you are losing shadow detail in particular when adjusting black point. In general, the contrast range of print is much lower than that of a computer screen, so this is normal. When you adjust your black point up, despite the lower contrast, you will actually be preserving shadow detail. You are essentially shifting shadow levels upwards, toward midtones, and making sure they will be visible in print (rather than simply being blotchy black spots.)\n",
      "Out of gamut colors can be trickier. Gamut overflow is usually caused by too much saturation, and can often be corrected by desaturating. If you enable the out of gamut comparison mode, and you only see relatively small areas or spatterings of pixels out of gamut, you can leave your colors alone. On the other hand, if you see large areas that are out of gamut, you will want to adjust your colors. If a broad range of color is out of gamut, you can simply desaturate the whole image a bit. If specific colors are out of gamut, you will want to use the color picker tool of the saturation adjustment tool to select the specific colors that are out of gamut, and desaturate them a bit. If you have to desaturate too much that you lose the kind of vibrancy you want, you can also try adjusting the hue or lightness of the out of gamut colors. Sometimes, a combination of slight adjustments to two or three of these will be sufficient to shrink or eliminate your out of gamut areas without eliminating essential detail and color contrast.\n",
      "Out of gamut color can be a tricky thing. It is very important to soft proof with the proper rendering intent. If you soft proof with Relative Colorimetric intent, and correct colors with that intent, then print with Perceptual intent, your print will most likely come out very wrong. Rendering intents may also be able to take care of out of gamut color for you. If you do not see any artifacts specifically caused by out of gamut colors, such as posterization, harsh saturation cliffs, blocked or clipped colors, etc. then you may want to leave color correction to ICM, and let your rendering intent shift out of gamut colors as appropriate for your target device and paper. If you have the option, printing a sample print on a smaller paper size of the same paper type to perform an actual hard proof will demonstrate exactly how out of gamut colors will look when printed. If the print has the same issues as your soft proof, then color adjustment will be necessary to correct those artifacts. Another option for correcting gamut conversion artifacts is to create your own print profile. This requires hardware, and your own printer, so it will not solve problems with third-party printers. The results with custom calibration can be stunning, and will often preserve a wider gamut than profiles generated by a paper or printer manufacturer. \n",
      "To specifically address your clipped highlights and blocked blacks problem, I would create a copy of your wedding photos, and soft proof them agains the ICM color profiles your third-party printer will be using. You will probably have to ask them what hardware they use, and possibly ask them for an ICM profile for the printer if you can not find it online. If the current prints you have appear to have correct color, I would not bother enabling the out of gamut warning mode, and simply adjust your white and black points. If your current prints do appear to have some out of gamut color issues, then you will need to be very specific about how you soft proof and correct that. You will need to know the rendering intent that your third-party printer will print at, in addition to having the necessary ICM profile. You will want to make all corrections in the correct rendering intent, if possible. The two most likely intents are Relative Colorimetric, and Perceptual, however there is also Absolute Colorimetric, which can be rather problematic.\n",

We mounted the plate and Ernie pressed the Red button - the drill moved until it was exactly over the red cross. Then he pressed the Blue button and simultaneously started a stop-watch.

      "\"Have a look at this\" said Ernie when he dropped in unannounced yesterday, pulling what looked like an old-fashioned photographic negative from an envelope. I held the small plastic square up to the light and peered at it, but could see nothing except the grey glossy surface. But after a few seconds later it appeared to turn completely transparent so I could see the light fitting through it. \"Try the other side\", he suggested. I did, and almost dropped it in surprise as I saw an eye staring back at me. A few seconds the eye image faded to a view of the other side of the room. \"It's a new ultra-high refractive index plastic from Acme Industries\" said Ernie. \"They call it slow glass\". He went on to explain that the speed of light through a transparent material was inversely proportional to its refractive index. \"...and this material has a refractive index of approximately 10^18\". I must have looked confused so, putting on his 'explain-this-to-a-small-child' face he continued \"So light hitting one side of a surface coating only a manometer thick would take almost 4 seconds to get out the other side\".\n",
      "\"Interesting\", I said, \"but I can't imagine it being very useful. Just consider the risk of accident if you used it in a car windscreen\". But Ernie assured me that while previously it had been a 'solution waiting for a problem', he had now identified the perfect problem. \"As you know\", he announced (I didn't), \"there is a lunar eclipse visible from here in just a few days. Two weeks later there will be a solar eclipse visible in the Kzijekistan hinterlands. I would love to see both but it will take a 16 day trek to get to the site of the solar eclipse and set up my equipment.\" I murmured some commiserations, but Ernie wasn't finished. \"Don't you see - the slow glass is perfect. If someone\" (he looked pointedly at me) \"exposes a 1.0 mm thick sheet to the lunar eclipse the light will take 40 days to get through so I will have plenty of time to get back and make all the required observations\".\n",
      "He assured me I would need no astronomical abilities (just nimble fingers). \"My attic sky-light is perfectly oriented for a great view of the eclipse. All you need to do is tape slow glass sheets up to the sky-light during the eclipse, then store them safely for my return\". He went on to explain that as slow glass was a 'very new thing' he didn't quite know the best size or exposure times for optimal eclipse viewing. So he had come up with a cleverly designed compromise involving multiple sheets of slow glass and a range of different exposure times. \"It's all very simple\", he announced passing an envelope to me, \"I have writen down explicit instructions for you\".  And then he looked at his watch, told me he had to rush and finish packing for the solar eclipse trip, and left with a cheerful farewell.\n",

I would love to see both but it will take a 16 day trek to get to the site of the solar eclipse and set up my equipment.\" I murmured some commiserations, but Ernie wasn't finished. \"Don't you see - the slow glass is perfect. If someone\" (he looked pointedly at me) \"exposes a 1.0 mm thick sheet to the lunar eclipse the light will take 40 days to get through so I will have plenty of time to get back and make all the required observations\".\n",
      "He assured me I would need no astronomical abilities (just nimble fingers). \"My attic sky-light is perfectly oriented for a great view of the eclipse. All you need to do is tape slow glass sheets up to the sky-light during the eclipse, then store them safely for my return\". He went on to explain that as slow glass was a 'very new thing' he didn't quite know the best size or exposure times for optimal eclipse viewing. So he had come up with a cleverly designed compromise involving multiple sheets of slow glass and a range of different exposure times. \"It's all very simple\", he announced passing an envelope to me, \"I have writen down explicit instructions for you\".  And then he looked at his watch, told me he had to rush and finish packing for the solar eclipse trip, and left with a cheerful farewell.\n",

The idea is that the first inversion maps the unit sphere to itself, and then we can translate by $a=(1,0,0,\\ldots)$ to map the point $-a$ of the unit sphere to the origin, which will then be mapped to infinity by the second inversion. A sphere with a point at infinity is a plane. It is easy to see that it will be given by the equation $x_1=1/2$ by considering where does the point $a$ of the sphere map, together with the symmetry of the construct. \n",

      "The essence of the theorem is that (given the assumptions) one cannot mix space-time symmetries with internal symmetries in a non-trivial way. E.g. one cannot have non-trivial commutators $[P_\\mu, B]\\neq 0$ for $P$ the momentum and $B$ an internal symmetry. It also says that one cannot have higher-spin conserved charges (i.e. a \"momentum\" with two indices $P_{\\mu\\nu}$). The latter actually follows from rather simple kinematical considerations, which show that scattering has to be trivial if such charges exist.\n",

In this case they find the same result with Poincare algebra replaced by super-Poincare algebra. The latter contains Poincare algebra, supersymmetry generators (fermionic supercharges), and $R$-symmetry generators. $R$-symmetry is a kind of \"internal\" symmetry which mixes with ferminonic space-time symmetries -- the supercharges are charged under this symmetry. Still, Poincare generators do not mix with it, and the bosonic part of $\\mathfrak g$ obeys Coleman-Mandula theorem. \n",
      "There are some modifications for gapless theories, which give rise to (super-)conformal algebras, but for me the meaning of it is not clear, since conformal field theories do not have a S-matrix in canonical sense. Super-conformal cases can be more rigorously dealt with by looking for super-Lie algebras which have a conformal subalgebra. This leads to a classification of superconformal algebras in any spacetime dimension (one of the results is that there are no superconformal algebras in higher than 6 spacetime dimensions).\n",

If you have access to the email you can get the account key and if you have access to the account key then you don't need access to the email.\n",

This means that when I typed my secret password in the client, even if I response to a challenge from an evil server, my secret password is still safe.\n",
      "It's the same thing with your credit card. The smart chip on your credit card contains a secret key that is used to answer a challenge-response every time you make a purchase. This secret key is protected even if you make a purchase from an evil terminal.\n",
      "Note : An advantage of the challenge-response mechanism is also that it lets the user reuse the same password with multiple server. This point is need for credit card for example as they will use many terminals (servers) and only have one password.\n",

In your concrete problem, the equation is $y_tt=y_xx-2by_t,$ and introducing the Ansatz $y=XT$ we get:\n",

In English, adding do support can give a statement emphasis, but it doesn't change the meaning.

You can get away with it when you're talking about shares, since shares are countable, so amount cannot refer to shares.

If I've heard anybody use \"I have not to\", I have forgotten it. But given the rules of English grammar, it should mean the same thing as \"I don't have to\".\n",
      "The only difference between \"I have not to\" and \"I don't have to\" is that one uses do-support and the other doesn't. In English, adding do support can give a statement emphasis, but it doesn't change the meaning. In the same way that \"I haven't a clue\" means the same thing as \"I don't have a clue\", wouldn't the natural assumption be that \"I haven't to go\" means \"I don't have to go\"? \n",
      "Of course, if \"I haven't to\" was an idiom, the idiomatic usage could overrule this natural assumption. But nobody uses it, so it's not an idiom. So I have to believe that if it means anything, it means \"I don't have to\". \n",
      "UPDATE: In the book Survey of English Dialects, found through Google books, it says that \"I haven't to\" means \"I mustn't\" in the Du dialect of English. So in some region of England, it is an idiom. Outside of that region, I would assume that it means I don't have to, which is what it seems to mean in the majority of the instances I have found through  Google books. I can't be sure what Du means, since the key isn't on one of the previewable pages but it's probably Durham, a city and a county in northern England.  \n",
      "You can't say In the OP's sentence with when, the position of \"the next day\" clause makes it ungrammatical. From the position of \"the next day\" clause, it should mean the day after he sells his bicycle. That interpretation makes no sense, so we discount it. However, even when we realize \"the next day\" is the day after your friend told you this, the sentence still sounds wrong. \n",
      "The right way of making it into reported speech without \"the next day\" clause is with a capital 'T'. So I would say the rule is to capitalize the initial letter even if the sentence starts with an apostrophe.\n",
      "And here is an example from the year 1897 which not only capitalizes the E in 'E, but also capitalizes the A in 'Allelujahs: \n",
      "The predicate is not there because you didn't quote the entire sentence in your question. The main clause of the sentence is the one starting I take up my pen ... From the Columbia University Annual Report of 1915, we have: The earliest I can find this usage in Google Books is from 1932: Fraught originally had a verb; I don't know whether worth ever did. So if your products can be both uncountable and countable nouns, you should use quantity. However, quantity sounds wrong if you're talking about money. \n",
      "I see no advantage to using amount rather than total for  the total cost. You can get away with it when you're talking about shares, since shares are countable, so amount cannot refer to shares.  However, if you also have uncountable nouns possible for your products, then people could get the amount column and the quantity column confused. So I'd recommend using your second example.  \n",
      "The Etruscans (where the Romans got their alphabet) learned to read and write from the Greeks. In ancient Greek, lego meant to say or to recite, as well as to gather and to put in order (although it seems that with respect to reading, it could only mean to read aloud). Possibly the Etruscans, who would have already had words for say and recite, but not for read, took the meaning of recite from Greek and changed it to mean to read.\n",
      "And the Greek meaning of lego would have come from the idea of putting words in order. \n",
      "This seems more likely to me than the possibility that the meanings to read (but not to recite) in Latin and to recite in Greek developed independently from the same root meaning to gather.   these mean that something is valuable, usually with respect to the current subject of discussion. Also  \n",
      "Strange as it seems, cannon does appear to have once been a mass noun, like rain or infantry. Instead of saying rains, one says drops of rain. Similarly, instead of saying cannons, it appears that one either said cannon or pieces of cannon. Consider the google Ngram below: I'd call it a \"false sense of security\". This phrase is fairly common, and in fact security is by far the most popular word appearing after \"false sense of\": See Ngrams. You could use the singular speed if they were going the same speed, but if they are going two different speeds, you have to use the plural.\n",
      "For the OP's question, presumably diabetes and obesity each have a different prevalence, so you need the plural: \n",
      "My impression is that \"down the shore\" is what some people from New York/New Jersey/Philadelphia say to mean they're going to the Jersey Shore, which is south of New York. It was also the name of a sitcom set in Belmar, a town on the Jersey Shore. If you're in New York City, and you go to a beach on Long Island, that is not \"down the shore\".  \n",
      "There are many, many examples of words where the verb is stressed on the second syllable and the noun is stressed on the first syllable. Wikipedia gives an incomplete list of around 200 words like this.\n",
      "I suspect that this transitive use of progress was derived from the noun (possibly from the phrase make progress on), and so retained the stress of the noun, at least for a while. I can't find any confirmation of this from the OED (which does say that this is originally a U.S. usage, first attested in 1780, and gives the 1814 citation \"Nor have there been wanting projects among them [sc. Americans] for getting rid of the English language, not merely by barbarizing it—as when they progress a bill ...\") I don't think there is anything wrong with any of these sentences.  The expression being used is wave off, not waive off.\n",

      "The past participles (and past tenses) \"speeded\" and \"sped\" are used in different grammatical situations. When \"speed\" is an intransitive verb, the past tense is almost invariably \"sped\". When \"speed\" is a transitive verb, the past tense is usually \"speeded\" (although \"sped\" is being increasingly used in this situation). \n",
      "Consider the Google Ngram for \"speeded/sped down the road\". It's almost always \"sped\". Now, compare the Google Ngram for \"speeded/sped the process\". It's usually \"speeded\", although \"sped\" is now becoming more common.  \n",
      "There's a reasonable progression from \"getting a kick out of something\" to \"being on a Sailor Moon kick.\" This is through references to alcohol or drugs; here being on a kick could mean an extended period of using alcohol or drugs.\n",

      "Let me give you a few basic facts about of representation theory of $SO(N)$ groups (set $N=d-1$ for the situation at hand; also, we should be talking about the universal cover $Spin(N)$, but to be more general let's pretend that we are working with complex Lie algebra $so(N,\\mathbb{C})$ -- the representation theory over $\\mathbb{C}$, in which one is interested in this case, is independent of signature, and is equivalent to that of $so(N,\\mathbb{C})$). There are two different cases, $N=2n$ and $N=2n+1$. In the former case the Lie algebra of $SO(N)$ is of $D_n$ type and in the latter of $B_n$ type; the representation theory is slightly different in these two cases. \n",
      "The first thing to know is that $SO(N)$ is reductive for any $N$ -- that is, all its finite dimensional representations decompose as a direct sum of irreducible representations, so you only need to know what are the irreducible representations. The second thing to know is that for $N>3$ ($d>4$) there is no single \"spin\" which labels the representations of $SO(N)$, but instead you need to specify the weight, which is a vector of $n$ numbers (recall $N=2n$ or $N=2n+1$). That is just how the life works, and there is no way around this. In particular, for $N>3$ spinor and vector representations are not naturally members of the same family labeled by a single spin, so there is no reason to expect that dimension of spinor representation will be smaller than the dimension of vector representation (and this is in fact false). \n",
      "These $n$ numbers can be taken to be the so-called Dynkin labels, and we can write them as a list $[\\lambda_1,\\ldots,\\lambda_n]$. The $\\lambda_i$ are all independent non-negative integers. To show you the basic idea, let us consider $SO(5)$ and $SO(6)$ with $n=2$ and $n=3$ respectively. For $SO(5)$ the simplest representations, which one usually calls spin-$j$, are $[j,0]$. These are rank-$j$ traceless totally symmetric tensors. The spinor representation is, however, $[0,1]$, so it is not a part of this family. For $SO(6)$ we also have the family $[j,0,0]$ and two chiral spinor representations $[0,1,0]$ (left-handed) and $[0,0,1]$ (right-handed). As you can see, spinors are again not a part of the family. More generally, for $N=2n+1$ the last label is the \"spinor label\", and for $N=2n$ the last two labels are the \"spinor labels\".\n",
      "Now, let me stress that you cannot set $j=\\frac{1}{2}$ above, because the labels must be integers. You can in $SO(3)$ because there we have the vector $[\\lambda_1]$ and $\\lambda_1$ is the spinor label and the traceless-symmetric \"spin-$j$\" family is $[2j]$, a low-dimensional peculiarity. (There is also a similar\n",

      "\n",
      "Let me give you a few basic facts about of representation theory of $SO(N)$ groups (set $N=d-1$ for the situation at hand; also, we should be talking about the universal cover $Spin(N)$, but to be more general let's pretend that we are working with complex Lie algebra $so(N,\\mathbb{C})$ -- the representation theory over $\\mathbb{C}$, in which one is interested in this case, is independent of signature, and is equivalent to that of $so(N,\\mathbb{C})$). There are two different cases, $N=2n$ and $N=2n+1$. In the former case the Lie algebra of $SO(N)$ is of $D_n$ type and in the latter of $B_n$ type; the representation theory is slightly different in these two cases. \n",
      "The first thing to know is that $SO(N)$ is reductive for any $N$ -- that is, all its finite dimensional representations decompose as a direct sum of irreducible representations, so you only need to know what are the irreducible representations. The second thing to know is that for $N>3$ ($d>4$) there is no single \"spin\" which labels the representations of $SO(N)$, but instead you need to specify the weight, which is a vector of $n$ numbers (recall $N=2n$ or $N=2n+1$). That is just how the life works, and there is no way around this. In particular, for $N>3$ spinor and vector representations are not naturally members of the same family labeled by a single spin, so there is no reason to expect that dimension of spinor representation will be smaller than the dimension of vector representation (and this is in fact false). \n",
      "These $n$ numbers can be taken to be the so-called Dynkin labels, and we can write them as a list $[\\lambda_1,\\ldots,\\lambda_n]$. The $\\lambda_i$ are all independent non-negative integers. To show you the basic idea, let us consider $SO(5)$ and $SO(6)$ with $n=2$ and $n=3$ respectively. For $ SO(5)$ the simplest representations, which one usually calls spin-$j$, are $[j,0]$. These are rank-$j$ traceless totally symmetric tensors. The spinor representation is, however, $[0,1]$, so it is not a part of this family. For $SO(6)$ we also have the family $[j,0,0]$ and two chiral spinor representations $[0,1,0]$ (left-handed) and $[0,0,1]$ (right-handed). As you can see, spinors are again not a part of the family. More generally, for $N=2n+1$ the last label is the \"spinor label\", and for $N=2n$ the last two labels are the \"spinor labels\".\n",
      "Now, let me stress that you cannot set $j=\\frac{1}{2}$ above, because the labels must be integers. You can in $SO(3)$ because there we have the vector $[\\lambda_1]$ and $\\lambda_1$ is the spinor label and the traceless-symmetric \"spin-$j$\" family is $[2j]$, a low-dimensional peculiarity. (There is also a similar\n",

      "My advice to you regarding overblows would be this: before you can know if your harp is overblowing, you need to be able to overblow.  This may seem like a catch-22, but to really get the feeling for what an overblow feels like, you can \"force\" even a harmonica that won't usually overblow to do it.

      "(My qualifier to this would be, if you have a \"junk\" harmonica that you don't mind risking breaking, there's no harm in having some fun.  You very likely won't improve the harmonica but you might well enjoy yourself, and learn something.) \n",
      "My advice to you regarding overblows would be this: before you can know if your harp is overblowing, you need to be able to overblow.  This may seem like a catch-22, but to really get the feeling for what an overblow feels like, you can \"force\" even a harmonica that won't usually overblow to do it.  And make it a whole lot easier even for a harp that overblows well.\n",
      "When you overblow, the blow reed \"chokes\" and the draw reed sounds.  To get the harmonica to do this more easily, you can cover the blow reed yourself.  There are harmonicas designed specifically with this in mind (for example the suzuki overdrive with holes for the individual chambers), but that's a lot of money for essentially a teaching tool.  Instead, take the cover plates off so the reeds are exposed.  Then you can just use your fingers to cover reed slots.  Be gentle (with your hands and your airflow) and you won't do any damage.  \n",

      "More generally, replace $S_n$ by $D$, a union of a collection of closed balls of nonzero radius, and suppose $D$ has diameter greater than 1.  Consider partitions of $D$ which are bounded, so each set in a partition has diameter at most 1.  Let us further assume that $D$ contains two open balls with centers $x$ and $y$ of distance exactly 1 from one another.\n",
      "Consider the unit vector $v$ which is the difference of $x$ and $y$.  Then the points $tv + x$ and $tv+y$ are also distance 1 apart. Let $R_t$ be the partition part which contains these two points.  Then $R_t$ is different from $R_s$ when $t$ and $s$ are distinct real numbers sufficiently small. Thus continuum-many partition parts of diameter 1 are needed to cover just these pairs of points.  In particular, more than countably many parts are needed, so finitely many partitions each with a finite number of parts is not enough.  Thus we can't find a finite set of simple partitions for the poster even in the case of the unit square.\n",

      "One should be able to use the following ingredients to show that most any cardinality is possible.  Unfortunately, a missing piece is that the result is maximal commuting.  However, I give the other pieces now to inspire someone to answer the problem.\n",
      "For any commutative monoid M, one can enhance M by adding a new unit u to M to make M', as well as add a zero elements z and associated divisors of z to make a larger commutative monoid. One can use a version of Cayley's Theorem to embed such monoids into the desired set X.  So End(X) will have commutative submonoids of any desired possible cardinality.\n",
      "Since X is infinite, there may be a chance of making a twist to these embeddings to make them maximal. Unfortunately my hand waving efforts fail me here.\n",

      "More generally, replace $S_n$ by $D$, a union of a collection of closed balls of nonzero radius, and suppose $D$ has diameter greater than 1.  Consider partitions of $D$ which are bounded, so each set in a partition has diameter at most 1.  Let us further assume that $D$ contains two open balls with centers $x$ and $y$ of distance exactly 1 from one another.\n",
      "Consider the unit vector $v$ which is the difference of $x$ and $y$.  Then the points $tv + x$ and $tv+y$ are also distance 1 apart. Let $R_t$ be the partition part which contains these two points.  Then $R_t$ is different from $R_s$ when $t$ and $s$ are distinct real numbers sufficiently small. Thus continuum-many partition parts of diameter 1 are needed to cover just these pairs of points.  In particular, more than countably many parts are needed, so finit ely many partitions each with a finite number of parts is not enough.  Thus we can't find a finite set of simple partitions for the poster even in the case of the unit square.\n",

      "I don't understand the process well enough to compute it.  However, it seems two or more nearly equilateral triangles are created after two iterations.\n",
      "Consider the map from largest angle of a triangle to largest angle of a triangulation. As seen above, 60 degrees maps to 120.  Consider this map over all triangles.  This angular map may not be the one you are finally interested in, but a similar map (largest angle of initial triangle to largest angle of resulting configuration) derived from two or four iterations of your process may show you how quickly it blows up.\n",

      "Some of the best references are people.  Reference librarians can help in ways most mathematicians can't.  If you have the opportunity, see what Interlibrary Loan programs your local library has.  The people at that library may be able to find online sources or services that will deliver whole books or sections to you electronically.  Also, building up your list of favorites (and saving it somewhere in the computing cloud) will be useful.\n",
      "If your research interests are specific enough, you might find an Internet mailing list or discussion group which has their list of favorite references.  However, MathOverflow will probably not give you that list, and suggest you try searching other forums for such.\n",

In this case, it is fairly obvious which meaning was intended, so it is fine as it is. However, there are cases where the resulting sentence becomes truly ambiguous; you should try to avoid such cases (although even native speakers don't always succeed in doing this).\n",

Installation of a crown race will require a special tool (if you want to do it right) if it is not a split type race- split races go on with no special tools. For removal of any of the above,if it took a special tool to go on, it will take a special tool to come off. Yes, you can use a screwdriver if you don't mind gnarling up your components. Typically not during the turn. I've seen it done it the wet sometimes, but taking your foot out/off of the pedal during a turn will affect up your balance, especially on a road bike. Getting your foot out of pedal at the last minute is really hard, especially with road pedals.\n",

      "This is pretty subjective. I'd say it's preference. Some riders truly have enough skill on a fixed gear bike to go without a rear brake. Most do it because of convention. It's considered unfashionable to have a rear brake on a fixie, and for many fixed gear riders form trumps function. In my opinion its a little foolish not to have a rear brake. Backpedaling to stop on a fixie is bad for your knees and in an emergency stopping situation it's harder to give the bike the body english it may need while you're trying to push backwards on the pedals at the same time. On the flip side, having a rear brake on the bike isn't going to hurt anything, though some hipster might dock you on style points. In my book that's just another plus. \n",
      "It is true that integrated headsets can wiggle a fraction of a millimeter when properly installed, more if they're not adjusted correctly. For most bikes, the wear caused by a properly adjusted integrated headset is going to be trivial. Something else on the frame will likely fail before the bore for the cartridge bearing gets wallowed out. Keep in mind that the head tube is not the bearing race for an integrated headset- you're just dropping a cartridge bearing down into the head tube and with cartridge bearings the ra ces are part of the package.\n",
      "if you run your headset out of adjustment continuously you may wear some slop into an integrated headset, but running a headset too loose can cause damage to any headtube regardless of the headset it accepts.\n",

      "The Canon iPF 8300 is one of the more advanced large-format, commercial printers available on the market today. It is indeed designed to produce the highest quality large format prints possible. The key thing about the 8300 is that it uses Lucia EX ink, which is a very new pigment ink formulation specifically designed to produce a wide gamut on print. Similar to Epson's Ultrachrome HDR ink, the solid color gamut reproducible by Lucia EX supports over 90% of the Pantone Solid Color matching system on supported paper types. The Epson 7900 and 9900 are Epson's counterparts, and offer up to 98% Pantone on a specific paper type and at maximum DPI.\n",
      "Ink is the primary factor that affects print output, quality, and gamut. If you intend to create prints that most accurately reproduce color and render fine tonal gradients smoothly, I highly recommend a Canon printer that supports Lucia EX ink, or an Epson printer that supports Ultrachrome HDR ink. For the widest gamut possible on a variety of unique paper types, such as metallic, you might want to look at the Epson Stylus Pro WT7900. This printer uses a new white ink, part of the Ultrachrome HDR + White ink set, which allows more control over highlight tones and possibly even white point. When it comes to HP printers, they are currently not as competitive in the area of ink as Canon and Epson are. Their Vivera pigment ink seems to date back to 2006, which is pretty old by current standards. Canon Lucia EX was released in March 2010, and Epson Ultrachrome HDR was released late 2009, so these brands have a considerable edge over the competition when it comes to accurate color reproduction.\n",
      "As for which paper type is best...thats a much more subjective area. Both Canon and Epson wide-gamut, large format printers only support their maximum gamuts on a small range of their own brand of papers. A wide gamut is still supported for other papers, including off-brand papers, however they can't guarantee 90% Pantone Solid Color coverage on every paper type (at least, not yet.) \n",
      "There are several key factors in choosing a paper for your prints. Not every type of photography looks the same on any type of paper, so you need to choose paper types that compliment the type of photography you are printing. Some types look best on glossy or luster papers, some require bright white or pure white, other types look best on natural papers with warmer white points. Some experimentation will be necessary to identify which paper types, finishes, and white points best compliment the type of photography you are printing. In this area, Epson offers more brand name papers than others, however their papers are not necessarily the best, either. Canon offers a fairly broad range of paper, however much of it is manufactured by Hahnemuhle. There are also plenty of third party papers from manufacturers who have been in the business for hundreds of years, including Hahnemuhle (and Harman), Moab, Museo, Ilford, Breathing Color, etc. \n",
      "Certain factors of a paper affect the reproducible gmaut when printed on. One of the primary factors that affects gamut is the white point and white brightness of the paper. A \"purer\" white, one that falls around 5500K-6500K, will expand the reproducible gamut as well as maximum tonal range, as it is a purer, more \"white\" white. Cooler whites (that show up almost blue) or warmer whites (that show up with more orange or red) will reduce or shift the reproducible gamut, as the paper itself will affect color reproduction. Black and white prints tend to look best with a pure white paper, unless you want the artistic or warming effect of a \"natural\" white paper (which is what most matte fine art papers provide). The brighter the paper, the greater the tonal range is likely to be. Some papers include optical brighteners, which use UV sensitive material that absorbs UV light and emits light in visible wavelengths. Gloss, semigloss, luster papers often have optical brighteners, which can help improve gamut and tonal range...however since they have UV reactive components, they often require a specific kind of lighting to reproduce color correctly.\n",
      "Another aspect of print quality is paper texture. Not all paper is equal in this regard, and there are a variety of materials, including wood, cotton, bamboo, sugar cane fibers, used to create the printable surface of a paper. Certain fiber types bring out the most in certain types of photography, and certain textures can help add a bit of artistic flare.\n",
      "In my personal experience, I've found that gloss or luster papers are best paired with portraits, pure white papers are ideal for black and white prints, and photo rag (cotton) papers with a natural white produce superb landscape prints. I personally try to avoid papers with optical brighteners, however such papers may serve your specific type of photography well, so I would experiment.\n",

Here is a comparison of a line from the book and Egyptienne F™: If you select the text frames, you can adjust their widths to be the same as the longest line of text they contain. Since this is all poetry and there is no paragraph composing going on, I’ve made all my text here “No Break” in the paragraph style—that way, instead of manually dragging the side of the text frame to make the frame the right width, I can simply double-click on the width handle, and it auto-fits the frame width to its content (= the longest line):  As far as I know, you can’t.\n",

      "Its been a while since I have used Aperture, so I am not sure if Aperture 3 is the same. In Aperture 2, there were options just like in Lightroom to recover shadows and hightlights. If you wish to balance the contrast of your foreground out a bit, I would bring up the shadows slider a bit, which should brighten and recover detail in just the darkest shades of your image. Usually, tools like Aperture and Lightroom divide an image into four ranges of tone: shadows, fill, main color, and highlight. Adjusting shadows and highlight usually has little effect on the rest of the image. \n",
      "The filter thread size is generally mandated by the size of the front lens element. In the case of 50mm lenses, there are usually f/2.8 or f/2.5, f/1.8 or f/1.7, f/1.4, and f/1.2 aperture lenses. For a given focal length, to get a greater amount of maximum light, the lens body needs to be made wider to accommodate a larger maximum aperture, and the front lens element needs to be made larger to gather more light. It may not seem like much, but the difference in light between f/1.4 and f/1.2 is quite a bit, and the logistics of getting that much light down a 50mm lens without losing quality are rather complex.\n",
      "In the case of the two lenses you listed, one has a constant aperture, while the other has a variable aperture. The difference between f/2.8 and f/3.5 is not that significant. The 18-55 has a maximum aperture of f/5.6 at 55mm, while the 17-55 has a maximum aperture of f/2.8 at 55mm. That IS a significant difference, as 55/5.6 = 9.8mm physical aperture while 55/2.8 = 19.6mm physical aperture, about double the size. That would be why the f/2.8 lens requires a larger front lens element, which thereby dictates a larger filter thread. \n",
      "As someone who owns a 450D myself, and who has a friend who owns a 500D, I would say the 500D is worth it. Functionally, there are few differences. The 450D has a 12.2mp sensor, while the 500D has a 15.1mp sensor. Not a huge difference, but enough to make a difference. The 500D supports two stops higher ISO (6400 instead of 1600...12800 is digitally enhanced, which you can do in post processing yourself). The higher ISO is a significant feature, as there are times when the 450D just can't get the shot, even with a fast lens. Another significant update to the 500D is HD video capability. That may or may not be a factor for you, depending on whether you are interested in video or not.\n",
      "One of the more significant features of the 500D over the 450D is the LCD view screen. The 450D has a 230,000 dot 3\" screen, which is actually fairly low resolution by todays standards, and is rather dim at times. It can be difficult to read during the day when you are out and about. The 500D has a 920,000 dot screen, which is four times as high a resolution, and considerably brighter. Using the 500D in brighter conditions is a LOT nicer than using the 450D. The higher resolution also makes it a lot easier to review your pictures in-camera, as you can see a much finer level of detail. Trying to review pictures in the 450D can be frustrating at times, as you can really never tell if your sharpness and focus is acceptable until you view your images on a computer.\n",
      "All that said, the 550D is again another improvement on all of these features again, and brings some other new things into the game. The 550D has a much improved sensor with the same noise performance as the 7D. Additionally, the 550D brings full color metering to the Rebel line, which is a significant improvement over the previous metering sensors used in the 450D and 500D. The 550D also uses the Digic 4 image processor, so it is capable of outputting 14-bit RAW images, allowing for greater dynamic range and finer tonal gradations than the previous Rebels. \n",
      "The price difference between a 500D and 550D is about $100, and I would say that the 550D is DEFINITELY worth it. If I had to offer up a recommendation out of all three, it would be the 550D hands down. The 500D does offer some useful improvements over the 450D, however 14-bit images, full color metering, and 50% more megapixels than the 450D make the 550D hard to beat for only $100 more. At 10mm, you could expose the sky for 37 seconds before you start to experience star trails. At 16mm you could expose for about 23 seconds, and at 22mm you could expose for about 17 seconds. At 37 seconds you should be able to get a decent shot with good color, so long as you use the right ISO setting. At all exposure times, I would recommend taking a series of as many photos as you can...dozens, even a hundred. A tool like DeepSkyStacker could then be used to align them, eliminate noise, and stack them into a high resolution (even super resolution) and high color-fidelity final image.\n",
      "One area where my recommendation differs from Matt's is the ISO setting. I own a 7D myself, and at very high ISO's noise takes on a very different characteristic than at low and medium ISO settings. In particular, ISO 2000, and anything ISO 3200 and above, are really going to eat away at your color fidelity, while ISO 2500 and anything under ISO 2000 won't usually affect color fidelity in any seriously adverse way. It is unnecessary to use that high of an ISO setting with a Canon anyway, as read noise drops to its normative low by ISO 400, between 2.8 and 3.4 electrons worth, vs. 8.6e- at ISO 100 and 4.7e- at ISO 200). The ideal ISO level from a read noise and color fidelity standpoint would actually be ISO 800, where it is only 2.8e- (see SensorGen Canon 7D for details), although with the higher maximum saturation of ISO 400, the 3.3e- read noise won't be a major problem.\n",
      "You will probably want to tune your ISO setting, which affects the maximum saturation level, to the exposure time. A longer exposure will be more capable of saturating more, so at ISO 400 you could use 10mm and a 37second exposure so a higher max sat. level is useful. For a shorter exposure, such as at 22mm, you might want to bump ISO up to 800 to allow the exposure to saturate faster, and maximize SNR, etc. Keep in mind, the higher the ISO setting/shorter exposure you use, the more the random physical nature of light will affect your shots. At ISO 1600 or higher, with very short exposures of only a few seconds, regardless of whether you manage to saturate some pixels, a lot of pixels will likely never receive any light at all. At this point, taking as many shots as you can and stacking them in post will be the only way to really create a \"complete\" picture with high saturation and good color fidelity.  \n",
      "First off, while I'll try to offer some helpful advice, I think that each individual should develop a workflow that fits their own personality. There is no one \"correct\" photo management workflow. That said, here are a few tips: \n",
      "Yes, digital sensors are indeed sensitive to UV light, as well as a considerable amount of the infrared spectrum. Most digital sensors are equipped with multi-coated, multi-layered filters that are designed to filter out the extended ranges of UV and IR. Generally speaking, filtered digital sensors are sensitive to a much broader range of light than the human eye, from about 250nm (the near-UV range) through visible light (400nm to 750nm), and down about 780nm (the IR range). Unfiltered, a digital sensor is sensitive to a far greater range, from deep UV (200nm, true UV) down to true IR (as far as 900nm) [#1]. It should be noted that sensitivity is not constant throughout this range, and falloff is fairly rapid and becomes significant the farther away from 380nm you go. Same goes for the IR range. Human eyesight ranges on average from about 390nm through 700nm, while some people are more sensitive and able to see from about 380nm through 750nm.\n",
      "Despite the filtration applied to digital sensors, UV light is still a problem, and can affect color balance. In general, the ability to sense UV light is not a huge problem, as digital sensors have relatively weak sensitivity to blue, and the UV sensitivity is generally captured as blue. However, without proper filtration, UV dispersion can generate disruptive haze that can be captured by a digital sensor, which may result in a rather undesirable result. \n",
      "It should be noted that optical glass filters out a considerable amount of UV light. Most UV wavelengths up to around 310nm are blocked by the glass of a camera lens, and the remainder from 310nm up through 380nm can be blocked with a UV/Haze filter. If one wishes to create images in the UV light range, special lenses are available. Non-standard materials such as quartz or calcium fluoride have a greater transparency to the UV spectrum. From a camera imaging perspective, most research shows the most interesting UV wavelengths probably lie between 250nm and 310nm [#2]. To get a clear UV shot, you may need to remove the UV filter that covers the sensor itself. This is similar to removing the IR filter when modifying a camera for IR work, or may involve removing the entire filter apparatus, which would remove both UV and IR filters at the same time (depends on the camera.)\n",

Our own fix: our epithelial cells, which are prone to cancer because of the work they do and need for replication have a short and finite lifespan.  Much like the Replicants in Blade Runner.  These cells are born to die after their work is done.  But they can still turn into cancer because the nucleus and DNA blueprint is still on board and can be mutated.

For fixed $r$ and increasing $n$, we get that eventually $F(n) \\lt n(1+ \\epsilon)/r\\log n$.

      "I now choose $d'$ according to a tunable parameter $k$, so that I guarantee $|S|Cd'/\\log d' \\leq n/k\\log n$, or in terms of $r=\\log d'/\\log n$, so that $|S|Ck \\leq rn^{1-r}$.  Then when $h(n)C/r \\leq n^{1-r}/k$ and $1/k + 1/r \\leq C$, we get the desired inequality.\n",
      "We have $h(n) \\leq \\tau(n)/2$ for all $n$.  This seems to tip the balance.\n",
      "When we pick $4/7$ or $5/9$ for $r$, and choose $k$ to be $4$ or $20/3$ respectively to get $(1/r + 1/k)=C=1.95$, computer simulation suggests $h(n)Ck \\lt rn^{1-r}$ for all $n \\gt 5$ times $10^8$.  On the theory side, we compare $\\tau(n)Ck/2r$ with $n^{1-r}$ using upper bounds on $\\tau(n)$ like $1152(n/367567200)^{0.244651}$ to get that the bound holds for all $n\\gt 1.3$ times $10^{10}$.   So the bound $F(n) \\lt 1.95n/\\log n$ will be established for all $n$ once it is established for all the troublesome cases below $10^{11}$.  Computer experimentation gives that $F(n)\\log n/n$ achieves a maximum of less than $1.607$ when $n=60$ for integral $n \\in [2,10^8)$, so I'm feeling pretty good that $C=1.95$ will work for all $n$.\n",

      "Yes, that is exactly what the client does. It uses heuristics to do this, solving a subset/sum or knapsack problem.\n",
      "It uses a multi-pass approach, first trying to use only coins with at least six confirmations. In the next two passes it relaxes these requirements. Within each pass, it tries to minimize the number of transaction outputs claimed and then the amount of change returned.\n",
      "Note that all coins in your wallet are considered. In the accounting model that the Bitcoin client uses, specific coins do not belong to specific accounts.\n",
      "If you want to check the code yourself, search for  in . \n",
      "I think it's conceivable that this could happen. But under realistic cases, I don't think it actually will. If you don't mine on the longest block, the probability that your block will ever be part of the longest block drops drastically. Unless a block you mine becomes part of the longest chain and stays that way, you never get any fees or reward at all. \n",
      "To add a bit to the other answers: Imagine if the protocol required that timestamps increase. Now imagine somebody mines a block with a timestamp a minute in the future as far as you can tell. What do you do? If you try to mine blocks with the timestamp you currently believe is correct, your blocks will get rejected (since they'd have a timestamp earlier than the last accepted block).\n",
      "Due to the requirement that the network easily agree on whether a block is valid or not, the protocol can't require highly-accurate timestamps as a condition of accepting a block as valid. As a result, requiring monotonic timestamps would likely make things worse rather than better. \n",
      "The rule non-miners follow is that the longest chain wins. Miners need their blocks to be accepted by non-miners because it's non-miners (like exchanges and wallet providers) that decide which bitcoins have actual value.\n",
      "A miner who mines after your block will have the longest chain if he finds a block. A miner who ignores your block has to mine a block just to tie the longest chain and then mine another block to have the longest chain. The odds of him being able to mine two blocks before anyone else finds a block after your block are very, very low unless he controls (or conspires with) a very high proportion of mining power.\n",
      "So if he wants to get paid if he mines a block, he has a very strong incentive to mine after yours. You'd have to take that up with them. Thus far, they haven't.  \n",
      "There are two basic categories of applications for the type of distributed ledger technology behind Bitcoin.\n",
      "The first category are public systems like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple. These are systems with no central authority that provide open access to the world. The blockchain technology ensures eventual agreement on the state of the system so that changes in that state (whether they represent payments or something else) can be agreed upon. Anyone can participate in these networks so long as they follow the rules, with the rules being enforced by the software ignoring people who violate those rules.\n",
      "The second category are private/permissioned systems. These are systems that don't require a central authority for their day-to-day operation. They are generally run by a group of interested parties which formally manages group membership. The blockchain technology gives them data replication. Byzantine fault tolerance (protection even if some of the participants are malicious), and eventual (typically very rapid) agreement on the state of the network.

      "Yes, that is exactly what the client does. It uses heuristics to do this, solving a subset/sum or knapsack problem.\n",
      "It uses a multi-pass approach, first trying to use only coins with at least six confirmations. In the next two passes it relaxes these requirements. Within each pass, it tries to minimize the number of transaction outputs claimed and then the amount of change returned.\n",
      "Note that all coins in your wallet are considered. In the accounting model that the Bitcoin client uses, specific coins do not belong to specific accounts.\n",

      "I think it's conceivable that this could happen. But under realistic cases, I don't think it actually will. If you don't mine on the longest block, the probability that your block will ever be part of the longest block drops drastically. Unless a block you mine becomes part of the longest chain and stays that way, you never get any fees or reward at all. \n",
      "To add a bit to the other answers: Imagine if the protocol required that timestamps increase. Now imagine somebody mines a block with a timestamp a minute in the future as far as you can tell. What do you do? If you try to mine blocks with the timestamp you currently believe is correct, your blocks will get rejected (since they'd have a timestamp earlier than the last accepted block).\n",
      "Due to the requirement that the network easily agree on whether a block is valid or not, the protocol can't require highly-accurate timestamps as a condition of accepting a block as valid. As a result, requiring monotonic timestamps would likely make things worse rather than better. \n",
      "The rule non-miners follow is that the longest chain wins. Miners need their blocks to be accepted by non-miners because it's non-miners (like exchanges and wallet providers) that decide which bitcoins have actual value.\n",
      "A miner who mines after your block will have the longest chain if he finds a block. A miner who ignores your block has to mine a block just to tie the longest chain and then mine another block to have the longest chain. The odds of him being able to mine two blocks before anyone else finds a block after your block are very, very low unless he controls (or conspires with) a very hi gh proportion of mining power.\n",
      "So if he wants to get paid if he mines a block, he has a very strong incentive to mine after yours. You'd have to take that up with them. Thus far, they haven't.  \n",
      "There are two basic categories of applications for the type of distributed ledger technology behind Bitcoin.\n",
      "The first category are public systems like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple. These are systems with no central authority that provide open access to the world. The blockchain technology ensures eventual agreement on the state of the system so that changes in that state (whether they represent payments or something else) can be agreed upon. Anyone can participate in these networks so long as they follow the rules, with the rules being enforced by the software ignoring people who violate those rules.\n",
      "The second category are private/permissioned systems. These are systems that don't require a central authority for their day-to-day operation. They are generally run by a group of interested parties which formally manages group membership. The blockchain technology gives them data replication. Byzantine fault tolerance (protection even if some of the participants are malicious), and eventual (typically very rapid) agreement on the state of the network. The cryptography also ensures that the past is tamperproof and provable. \n",

      "SSLv2 has the property that after it receives an encryption of the pre-master secret, the server sends a message that uses the derived key. (This is unlike SSLv3 where the server first checks the MAC from the client.) Now, when using a ciphersuite with 40-bit keys, it is possible to brute force and find the derived key. Importantly, in SSLv2, the derived key is just 40 bits of the pre-master secret (no hashing or anything). So, this gives an oracle for finding 40 bits of the pre-master secret. It is possible to use this to quickly find all of the bits of the pre-master secret, 40 bits at a time. \n",
      "Some more details. In SSLv2 the RSA encryption uses PKCS#1 v1.5 padding. In order to prevent Bleichenbacher's attack, if the padding is incorrect the server just chooses a random secret and uses that instead (this fix was used throughout SSL versions). Thus, an attacker modifying the ciphertext cannot know if the padding was incorrect and this is a random value or if the padding was correct and this is the real value. The DROWN attack works by sending the SSLv2 server the same modified ciphertext twice. If the same key is used to compute the server reply both times, then the attacker knows that the padding was correct. (It also gets more information since as I wrote it gets 40 bits of the plaintext.) If the same result is not received both times, then the attacker knows that the padding was incorrect. The attacker knows if the same key was used since it just needs to brute force one of the messages in $2^{40}$ time to get the key. It can then try and see if that key matches the other ciphertext. All of this works since the server replies immediately and the attacker does not need to send a message with a correct MAC in order to get the server reply.\n",

      "This is an incorrect definition of CSPRNG and is misleading for people on this website. Forward security is an additional property that may be desirable, but this is certainly not the standard notion. Thus, it is incorrect to even say things like \"AES-CTR is not a CSPRNG under this definition\". Rather, please be exact, and say \"AES-CTR does not fulfill forward security\". \n",
      "I suggest that you look at Signcryption; a short survey appears here, and efficient schemes appear here. Just signing then encrypting or vice versa in a naive way is not secure (especially in the multi-user setting). So you have to do this right. Once you have a concrete scheme, you then have to see what level of security the encryption scheme needs to be. Typically it does need to be CCA secure, and the way to build CCA-secure symmetric encryption is the same as authenticated encryption. (Note that doing hybrid encryption or KEM/DEM, you need both the asymmetric and symmetric parts to be CCA secure.)  However, it really depends on exactly what you are doing.

      "SSLv2 has the property that after it receives an encryption of the pre-master secret, the server sends a message that uses the derived key. (This is unlike SSLv3 where the server first checks the MAC from the client.) Now, when using a ciphersuite with 40-bit keys, it is possible to brute force and find the derived key. Importantly, in SSLv2, the derived key is just 40 bits of the pre-master secret (no hashing or anything). So, this gives an oracle for finding 40 bits of the pre-master secret. It is possible to use this to quickly find all of the bits of the pre-master secret, 40 bits at a time. \n",
      "Some more details. In SSLv2 the RSA encryption uses PKCS#1 v1.5 padding. In order to prevent Bleichenbacher's attack, if the padding is incorrect the server just chooses a random secret and uses that instead (this fix was used throughout SSL versions). Thus, an attacker modifying the ciphertext cannot know if the padding was incorrect and this is a random value or if the padding was correct and this is the real value. The DROWN attack works by sending the SSLv2 server the same modified ciphertext twice. If the same key is used to compute the server reply both times, then the attacker knows that the padding was correct. (It also gets more information since as I wrote it gets 40 bits of the plaintext.) If the same result is not received both times, then the attacker knows that the padding was incorrect. The attacker knows if the same key was used since it just needs to brute force one of the messages in $2^{40}$ time to get the key. It can then try and see if that key matches the other ciphertext. All of this works since the server replies immediately and the attacker does not need to send a message with a correct MAC in order to get the server reply.\n",

      "This is an incorrect definition of CSPRNG and is misleading for people on this website. Forward security is an additional property that may be desirable, but this is certainly not the standard notion. Thus, it is incorrect to even say things like \"AES-CTR is not a CSPRNG under this definition\". Rather, please be exact, and say \"AES-CTR does not fulfill forward security\". \n",
      "I suggest that you look at Signcryption; a short survey appears here, and efficient schemes appear here. Just signing then encrypting or vice versa in a naive way is not secure (especially in the multi-user setting). So you have to do this right. Once you have a concrete scheme, you then have to see what level of security the encryption scheme needs to be. Typically it does need to be CCA secure, and the way to build CCA-secure symmetric encryption is the same as authenticated encryption. (Note that doing hybrid encryption or KEM/DEM, you need both the asymmetric and symmetric parts to be CCA secure.)  However, it really depends on exactly what you are doing.

However, when you are encrypting your disk at the file level, this is a completely irrelevant issue. Also, XTS is not \"ideal\" in the sense that it's not truly a wide block cipher (defined as a pseudorandom permutation over the block size). It's a standard which is actually somewhat a compromise.\n",
      "If you are encrypting at file level, then I would recommend an authenticated encryption scheme. GCM is of course possible, but you need to make sure that you have a unique IV and you need to make sure you keep within the bounds. It is possible to use a nonce-misuse resistant version as well; this is highly recommended since nonce reuse is not disastrous (at the very worst will reveal that two files are identical, but if the file includes the path name then this can't happen). You will probably be concerned about speed, but good implementations are well under a cycle a byte and so cost nothing compared to the cost of reading/writing to disk.  \n",
      "For log-depth circuits, it is possible to use an information-theoretic version of Yao's garbled circuits. Note that in a garbled gate, each key is used to encrypt twice. Thus, if the keys on the input wires are double the length of the keys on the output wires, then one-time pad encryption can be used and the result is information theoretically secure. \n",
      "See the paper Gate Evaluation Secret Sharing and Secure One-Round Two-Party Computation by Vlad Kolesnikov, and references within. \n",
      "Your fundamental misunderstanding is that encryption does NOT provide security for plaintexts of different lengths. This is explicit in the definition, where indistinguishability only holds as long as the challenge plaintexts (of which one is encrypted) are of the same length.\n",
      "In practice, in cases where length reveals information, one needs to pad. Prover chooses a random $r\\in\\mathbb Z_{q_1\\cdot q_2}$ and computes $h_1 = g_1^r \\mod p_1$ and $h_2 = g_2^r \\mod p_2$, and sends $h_1,h_2$ to the verifier. \n",

      "The verifier checks that $g_1^z = h_1 \\cdot x_1^e \\mod p_1$ and $g_2^z = h_2 \\cdot x_2^e \\mod p_2$. \n",
      "If you are sending a single message, then you are basically fine. Of course, there is a very small amount of bias that can be leaked (for example, if two ciphertext blocks have the same value - and there's actually a very good chance that this is the case - then since you are using a permutation this leaks the fact that those two plaintext blocks are different).\n",
      "However, the situation is very different if you encrypt many plaintext. This is because if there is a collision on the input, then the attacker will be able to get the XOR of the plaintexts (in which case it learns everything). Thus, this reduces to the question of whether or not a random counter repeats. \n",
      "If you are sending many small messages, then there is a good chance that this will happen, so this is disastrous. If you are sending two messages, each of length $2^{32}$ blocks and you use a fully random CTR, then the question becomes what the probability is that the counters used in the two messages will \"overlap\". This is equivalent to the question of what the probability is that the two messages are of distance at least $2^{32}$ apart. This is actually very easy to compute for 2 messages: fix the first counter $CTR_1$ and then note that the next counter can be anywhere except for in the range of $CTR_1-2^{32}$ and $CTR_2+2^{32}$ (where addition is modulo $2^{64}$). This probability is easily computed at $2^{31}$. However, it is important to be aware that the probability degrades fast when you have more messages.\n",
      "For the above reason, a better strategy for CTR mode is to break the counter up into two parts: the first part is chosen at random, and the second part is then what is incremented. This is often what is done for AES with the first part being 96 bits and the second part being 32 bits. This means that you can only encrypt message of length $2^{32}$ at maximum (otherwise, you break them into two and use a new counter). However, with a 64-bit block you still get very weak bounds. However, if you KNOW that you are encrypting only a few very long messages, then you can do something like this. If you KNOW that you are encrypting many short messages then you are in trouble.\n",
      "Bottom line, 64-bit blocks these days are a problem... \n",
      "As pointed out by @indiscreteLogarithm, the hash function based on discrete log is just way to slow to be used in practice. However, I very much do NOT agree with the statement that there would not be advantages to the scheme. The DLP scheme has a rigorous proof of security relative to the discrete log problem which means that breaking it requires breaking the discrete log problem. Thus, breaking such a hash function would make the SHA1 break seem insignificant. If you are worried about quantum attacks, then there also hash functions based on the learning with errors problem (and other lattice problems), that are also provably secure. These hash functions based on lattices are also quite efficient. \n",
      "Anyway, bottom line, the \"only\" disadvantage is the fact that they are not efficient. However, this disadvantage is so significant that it means they are not really usable in practice. \n",
      "If one of the number has small factors, then it is easy to factorize everything. For example, $52 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 13$. Once this is computed, the other factor can also be found. Bottom line: factoring algorithms work very well when the prime factors are not too large, so the the \"hardest\" factoring problem is with two prime factors only (of equal size). \n",
      "It makes no sense since its nonsense. Let me explain why. Consider an attacker who captures a message of the form $(IV,c)$ for a plaintext $m$ that is not known to the attacker. The aim of the attacker is to \"push\" the message $m\\oplus\\Delta$ (e.g., the attacker wishes to flip some bits of $m$. Then, since CRC is linear, the attacker can compute $c'=c \\oplus(\\Delta,CRC(\\Delta))$ and \"push\" the message $IV,c'$ which will decrypt to $m\\oplus\\Delta$. \n",
      "Technically, one could argue that the text is just arguing that you can't push a message with an unknown IV and here I am reusing the IV. However, who cares if the attacker reuses or not; the recipient will accept reused IVs so the attack works.\n",

However, when you are encrypting your disk at the file level, this is a completely irrelevant issue. Also, XTS is not \"ideal\" in the sense that it's not truly a wide block cipher (defined as a pseudorandom permutation over the block size). It's a standard which is actually somewhat a compromise.\n",
      "If you are encrypting at file level, then I would recommend an authenticated encryption scheme. GCM is of course possible, but you need to make sure that you have a unique IV and you need to make sure you keep within the bounds. It is possible to use a nonce-misuse resistant version as well; this is highly recommended since nonce reuse is not disastrous (at the very worst will reveal that two files are identical, but if the file includes the path name then this can't happen). You will probably be concerned about speed, but good implementations are well under a cycle a byte and so cost nothing compared to the cost of reading/writing to disk.  \n",
      "For log-depth circuits, it is possible to use an information-theoretic version of Yao's garbled circuits. Note that in a garbled gate, each key is used to encrypt twice. Thus, if the keys on the input wires are double the length of the keys on the output wires, then one-time pad encryption can be used and the result is information theoretically secure. \n",
      "See the paper Gate Evaluation Secret Sharing and Secure One-Round Two-Party Computation by Vlad Kolesnikov, and references within. \n",
      "Your fundamental misunderstanding is that encryption does NOT provide security for plaintexts of different lengths. This is explicit in the definition, where indistinguishability only holds as long as the challenge plaintexts (of which one is encrypted) are of the same length.\n",
      "In practice, in cases where length reveals information, one needs to pad. Prover chooses a random $r\\in\\mathbb Z_{q_1\\cdot q_2}$ and computes $h_1 = g_1^r \\mod p_1$ and $h_2 = g_2^r \\mod p_2$, and sends $h_1,h_2$ to the verifier. \n",
      "The verifier sends a random challenge $e\\in\\{0,1\\}^t$.\n",
      "The prover replies with $z=r+es \\mod q_1\\cdot q_2$\n",
      "The verifier checks that $g_1^z = h_1 \\cdot x_1^e \\mod p_1$ and $g_2^z = h_2 \\cdot x_2^e \\mod p_2$. \n",
      "If you are sending a single message, then you are basically fine. Of course, there is a very small amount of bias that can be leaked (for example, if two ciphertext blocks have the same value - and there's actually a very good chance that this is the case - then since you are using a permutation this leaks the fact that those two plaintext blocks are different).\n",
      "However, the situation is very different if you encrypt many plaintext. This is because if there is a collision on the input, then the attacker will be able to get the XOR of the plaintexts (in which case it learns everything). Thus, this reduces to the question of whether or not a random counter repeats. \n",
      "If you are sending many small messages, then there is a good chance that this will happen, so this is disastrous. If you are sending two messages, each of length $2^{32}$ blocks and you use a fully random CTR, then the question becomes what the probability is that the  counters used in the two messages will \"overlap\". This is equivalent to the question of what the probability is that the two messages are of distance at least $2^{32}$ apart. This is actually very easy to compute for 2 messages: fix the first counter $CTR_1$ and then note that the next counter can be anywhere except for in the range of $CTR_1-2^{32}$ and $CTR_2+2^{32}$ (where addition is modulo $2^{64}$). This probability is easily computed at $2^{31}$. However, it is important to be aware that the probability degrades fast when you have more messages.\n",
      "For the above reason, a better strategy for CTR mode is to break the counter up into two parts: the first part is chosen at random, and the second part is then what is incremented. This is often what is done for AES with the first part being 96 bits and the second part being 32 bits. This means that you can only encrypt message of length $2^{32}$ at maximum (otherwise, you break them into two and use a new counter). However, with a 64-bit block you still get very weak bounds. However, if you KNOW that you are encrypting only a few very long messages, then you can do something like this. If you KNOW that you are encrypting many short messages then you are in trouble.\n",
      "Bottom line, 64-bit blocks these days are a problem... \n",
      "As pointed out by @indiscreteLogarithm, the hash function based on discrete log is just way to slow to be used in practice. However, I very much do NOT agree with the statement that there would not be advantages to the scheme. The DLP scheme has a rigorous proof of security relative to the discrete log problem which means that breaking it requires breaking the discrete log problem. Thus, breaking such a hash function would make the SHA1 break seem insignificant. If you are worried about quantum attacks, then there also hash functions based on the learning with errors problem (and other lattice problems), that are also provably secure. These hash functions based on lattices are also quite efficient. \n",
      "Anyway, bottom line, the \"only\" disadvantage is the fact that they are not efficient. However, this disadvantage is so significant that it means they are not really usable in practice. \n",
      "If one of the number has small factors, then it is easy to factorize everything. For example, $52 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 13$. Once this is computed, the other factor can also be found. Bottom line: factoring algorithms work very well when the prime factors are not too large, so the the \"hardest\" factoring problem is with two prime factors only (of equal size). \n",
      "It makes no sense since its nonsense. Let me explain why. Consider an attacker who captures a message of the form $(IV,c)$ for a plaintext $m$ that is not known to the attacker. The aim of the attacker is to \"push\" the message $m\\oplus\\Delta$ (e.g., the attacker wishes to flip some bits of $m$. Then, since CRC is linear, the attacker can compute $c'=c \\oplus(\\Delta,CRC(\\Delta))$ and \"push\" the message $IV,c'$ which will decrypt to $m\\oplus\\Delta$. \n",
      "Technically, one could argue that the text is just arguing that you can't push a message with an unknown IV and here I am reusing the IV. However, who cares if the attacker reuses or not; the recipient will accept reused IVs so the attack works.\n",

      "These income-driven physicians are pushing their self-pay (uninsured) patients towards the \"safety-net clinics,\" causing these clinics to carry a high % of the burden of uninsured patients while receiving fewer insured patients to recover costs.  That imbalances the distribution of reimbursement to practices.\n",
      "If there were limitless numbers of providers and clinics, it would be a minor issue.  \n",
      "But there is very limited space in medical schools and residency training programs.  There is a primary care physician shortage in the tens of thousands and rising.  These profit-driven physicians are taking up spots in training programs that could instead be taken by people willing to accept a good (but not exorbitant) income while investing in balancing and improving the system, rather than just draining the profits of it.\n",
      "So in summary, yes I do find it unethical.  But that is largely because it's in the setting of a broken, ineffective healthcare system (especially the insurance system) that drives costs excessively high and makes access to quality care a commodity, rather than a human right.\n",
      " These are uncomfortable questions, but that's because the realities of these issues ARE uncomfortable.  We try to hide behind the word \"person\" to shield us from the discomfort, but we can't change reality to fit our comfort levels.\n",
      "This would allow people of different belief systems to converse more logically about issues that absolutely must be discussed, without perpetuating the current cycle of conflict and misinformation.\n",
      "To summarize, by the argument I laid out (that if it is X at the end, if there is no significant switch, then it must be X from the start), there is not a good criteria for terminating another human's life at any developmental stage to use its cells.  The term personhood is inadequate, and more objective terminology should be used in these discussions.\n",
      "Something important to also consider is that this issue will soon be outdated. Pluripotent stem cells are being generated from other sources, and it will soon replace the use of embryo tissues. \n",
      "I hope this helps generate some interesting thought and discussion, and give you some points to research and consider further as you develop your presentation.\n",

It took three years and felt like such a waste of time. So, my second and third novel I have plotted. The story still changes, but much less than just making it up as I go. My second novel took ten weeks to draft by comparison.\n",
      "So, the first thing I do is pre-writing. I use Scapple and Scrivener. Scapple to plot and Scrivener to write and I find both exceptional tools. I gather photos of what my characters look like, and photos of people I’d like to base them on (I usually composite my characters from people I know well) until these people inhabit my mind on a daily basis. I visit settings (where possible) and take photos and notes. I do lots of research and keep notes. I imagine scenes that I really want in the book and start writing snippets of dialogue. And then I put this whole lot into Scapple. From there, I do a rough outline of the plot.\n",

      "I procrastinate for at least two weeks. I sit at my screen, staring at the blank page and check Facebook, Gmail and answer questions on here. Then I chastise myself … A LOT. Every day I try to spend less time procrastinating and at least try to write something, even if it’s just a line or two. And then I chastise myself for only writing a line or two. After beating myself up for a couple of weeks, I find I’m spending less time procrastinating and more time writing.\n",
      "As @SimonWhite points out, the secret is to write every day, even the weekends, even if it’s just a few hundred words. The reason is that writing a muscle that atrophies without use. The longer you leave it, the harder it is to use. Annie Dillard expresses it perfectly when she says: \n",
      "One of the best pieces of advice I've read, which I didn't believe at all when I first started writing (I think it was either Natalie Goldberg or Anne Lamott who said it, and either way every writer should read Writing Down The Bones and Bird by Bird) was don't hold onto your writing gems because you think they're gold dust and deserve a bigger, better project or worry that better ideas won't come further down the line. They will and they will be brighter.\n",
      "When I wrote my first novel I thought, I'll never come up with another idea this good, this has to be the best idea I'll ever get. I held onto it and honed it and honed it until I'd flogged the damn thing to death.\n",
      "Then I wrote my second novel and thought, no, no THIS is the best idea I've ever had. This is it, if I can't sell this, I can't sell ANYTHING. This is the end of the idea road, it doesn't get any better.\n",
      "And then I came up with my idea for my third novel!! :)\n",
      "So, when you have something that feels like gold, don't cling on to it for dear life. Don't hold anything back. Put it all in and put it out there. Don't be afraid. Even though you can't see it, just around the corner there's a bigger pot gold just sitting there waiting for you. And what's more exciting is that with every project, you're better equipped to handle what's in the pot!\n",

It took three years and felt like such a waste of time. So, my second and third novel I have plotted. The story still changes, but much less than just making it up as I go. My second novel took ten weeks t o draft by comparison.\n",
      "So, the first thing I do is pre-writing. I use Scapple and Scrivener. Scapple to plot and Scrivener to write and I find both exceptional tools. I gather photos of what my characters look like, and photos of people I’d like to base them on (I usually composite my characters from people I know well) until these people inhabit my mind on a daily basis. I visit settings (where possible) and take photos and notes. I do lots of research and keep notes. I imagine scenes that I really want in the book and start writing snippets of dialogue. And then I put this whole lot into Scapple. From there, I do a rough outline of the plot.\n",
      "The next part is by far the hardest for me: starting the book.\n",
      "I procrastinate for at least two weeks. I sit at my screen, staring at the blank page and check Facebook, Gmail and answer questions on here. Then I chastise myself … A LOT. Every day I try to spend less time procrastinating and at least try to write something, even if it’s just a line or two. And then I chastise myself for only writing a line or two. After beating myself up for a couple of weeks, I find I’m spending less time procrastinating and more time writing.\n",
      "As @SimonWhite points out, the secret is to write every day, even the weekends, even if it’s just a few hundred words. The reason is that writing a muscle that atrophies without use. The longer you leave it, the harder it is to use. Annie Dillard expresses it perfectly when she says: \n",
      "One of the best pieces of advice I've read, which I didn't believe at all when I first started writing (I think it was either Natalie Goldberg or Anne Lamott who said it, and either way every writer should read Writing Down The Bones and Bird by Bird) was don't hold onto your writing gems because you think they're gold dust and deserve a bigger, better project or worry that better ideas won't come further down the line. They will and they will be brighter.\n",
      "When I wrote my first novel I thought, I'll never come up with another idea this good, this has to be the best idea I'll ever get. I held onto it and honed it and honed it until I'd flogged the damn thing to death.\n",
      "Then I wrote my second novel and thought, no, no THIS is the best idea I've ever had. This is it, if I can't sell this, I can't sell ANYTHING. This is the end of the idea road, it doesn't get any better.\n",
      "And then I came up with my idea for my third novel!! :)\n",
      "So, when you have something that feels like gold, don't cling on to it for dear life. Don't hold anything back. Put it all in and put it out there. Don't be afraid. Even though you can't see it, just around the corner there's a bigger pot gold just sitting there waiting for you. And what's more exciting is that with every project, you're better equipped to handle what's in the pot!\n",
      "All the luck in the world to you.\n",

      "Your church is competitive, with factions.  Why does the god tolerate that?  Why might a parent tolerate rivalries among siblings?  This aspect of the religion is also the reason your god tolerates the ways of this \"impostor\".  But is he really an impostor?  Your imposter is (or started out as) a follower of the noble god - a child.  The imposter sees opportunity to advance his god and his faction by tapping the powers of the enemy.  I am reminded of Boromir's exclamation when he learns of the existence of the Ring of power.  Boromir wants to use the power of the enemy against him.   So we need oxygen under pressure.  That is what your space face mask would deliver. Doable?\n",
      "Pressure in the lungs requires a balancing atmospheric pressure as delivered by a pressurized suit, or by the column of air towering over my house.  If you just pump pressurized air in to the lungs, the pressure differential causes barotrauma .  Barotrauma happens to people on ventilators when air under too much pressure is used (in an effort to overcome stiff sick lungs and get the O2 in).  Barotrauma can happen when a diver breathes pressurized air at depth and then ascends holding breath.  The pressurized air in the lungs, no longer balanced by an equal external pressure from the outside water, expands in the lungs.  Your chest swells as your lungs increase in size.  Hopefully you exhale and let it out!  Too much and the air bursts out - either into body tissue spaces outside the lungs or into the bloodstream.  That last is an air embolism which can kill or cause a stroke.\n",
      "$URL$\n",
      "But positive pressure ventilation is definitely used, all the time.  People on ventilators are often ventilated with air slightly above atmospheric pressure: this is positive end expiratory pressure, or PEEP.  It is related to continuous positive airway pressure or CPAP which people use at home to prevent sleep apnea.\n",
      "So we can breathe pressurized air.  Barotrauma occurs when the pressure is too much over ambient.  On a ventilator 20 mm Hg PEEP (20 mm Hg over ambient pressure) is when it really starts getting to be too much.  Could 20 mm Hg pressure in the space mask deliver enough oxygen?  From the above, 39000 feet is 0.19 atmospheres pressure, which is 144 mm Hg.  Breathing that much unopposed pressure you would pop.\n",
      "If only there were some way to make the effective oxygen concentration greater than plain oxygen gas, which you have to have under pressure to get enough in there. Gas is so gaseous.  Could one achieve adequate O2 concentration at a very low pressure with some oxygen carrying liquid like perfluorocarbon?  Breathing oxygenated liquids is called liquid ventilation.  Maybe the system would flood the lungs and face mask with an oxygen carrying liquid, and on reclaiming it into the reservoir with exhalation oxygenate it a lot under pressure / remove CO2, then allow the user to inhale the liquid again.\n",
      "The Armstrong limit above is 46 mm Hg and so even with the liquid ventilation, body fluids would still be boiling and that has to be bad.  \n",
      "I would like to have this work somehow but I think your people are going to need pressure suits.  They can be very sleek, form fitting suits like speed skaters wear.

Copper is available in metallic form on the surface and the availability of copper introduced humans to the possibility that metal could be used for tools and melted and cast into other forms.  Experience with copper led to experience with copper alloys like bronze, and from there to iron and onward.\n",

The question suggests that this is off limits but an Earthlike planet with limited iron is very plausible: the light siliceous crust is thicker and so events energetic enough to bring iron to the surface are less common.  Iron is handy for metal etc but availability of dietary iron is a bigger deal for animal life generally - iron is necessary for hemoglobin.  Iron deficiency is problematic as it is in many parts of the world and would be even more problematic if iron were scarce.  I could imagine that animal life generally would be different - consider that high hemoglobin levels facilitate oxygen carrying to muscles and allow bursts of speed.  Either animals would do better with anaerobic metabolism for long periods or bursts of activity like this would not happen.\n",
      "Why does the father tolerate the dissolute ways of his younger son, this \"imposter\"?  Because he is his son.  \n",
      "Your church is competitive, with factions.  Why does the god tolerate that?  Why might a parent tolerate rivalries among siblings?  This aspect of the religion is also the reason your god tolerates the ways of this \"impostor\".  But is he really an impostor?  Your imposter is (or started out as) a follower of the noble god - a child.  The imposter sees opportunity to advance his god and his faction by tapping the powers of the enemy.  I am reminded of Boromir's exclamation when he learns of the existence of the Ring of power.  Boromir wants to use the power of the enemy against him.   So we need oxygen under pressure.  That is what your space face mask would deliver. Doable?\n",
      "Pressure in the lungs requires a balancing atmospheric pressure as delivered by a pressurized suit, or by the column of air towering over my house.  If you just pump pressurized air in to the lungs, the pressure differential causes barotrauma .  Barotrauma happens to people on ventilators when air under too much pressure is used (in an effort to overcome stiff sick lungs and get the O2 in).  Barotrauma can happen when a diver breathes pressurized air at depth and then ascends holding breath.  The pressurized air in the lungs, no longer balanced by an equal external pressure from the outside water, expands in the lungs.  Your chest swells as your lungs increase in size.  Hopefully you exhale and let it out!  Too much and the air bursts out - either into body tissue spaces outside the lungs or into the bloodstream.  That last is an air embolism which can kill or cause a stroke.\n",
      "$URL$\n",
      "But positive pressure ventilation is definitely used, all the time.  People on ventilators are often ventilated with air slightly above atmospheric pressure: this is positive end expiratory pressure, or PEEP.  It is related to continuous positive airway pressure or CPAP which people use at home to prevent sleep apnea.\n",
      "So we can breathe pressurized air.  Barotrauma occurs when the pressure is too much over ambient.  On a ventilator 20 mm Hg PEEP (20 mm Hg over ambient pressure) is when it really starts getting to be too much.  Could 20 mm Hg pressure in the space mask deliver enough oxygen?  From the above, 39000 feet is 0.19 atmospheres pressure, which is 144 mm Hg.  Breathing that much unopposed pressure you would  pop.\n",
      "If only there were some way to make the effective oxygen concentration greater than plain oxygen gas, which you have to have under pressure to get enough in there. Gas is so gaseous.  Could one achieve adequate O2 concentration at a very low pressure with some oxygen carrying liquid like perfluorocarbon?  Breathing oxygenated liquids is called liquid ventilation.  Maybe the system would flood the lungs and face mask with an oxygen carrying liquid, and on reclaiming it into the reservoir with exhalation oxygenate it a lot under pressure / remove CO2, then allow the user to inhale the liquid again.\n",
      "The Armstrong limit above is 46 mm Hg and so even with the liquid ventilation, body fluids would still be boiling and that has to be bad.  \n",
      "I would like to have this work somehow but I think your people are going to need pressure suits.  They can be very sleek, form fitting suits like speed skaters wear.  You can put some people wearing them on the front of your paperback.  Photo by Jan Smith: Blue sun during Brisbane dust storm\n",

Here is the division between Natural Law and Positive Law.  On one side there is what is classically described as the Natural Moral Law and that's everything that seems innate to nature.  When Aristotle looked at a rock and said, \"what does it do?\" he was describing the Natural (Natural) Law when Plato considered the God of the universe and said, \"what does He do?\" he was describing the Natural (Eternal) Law.  \n",
      "On the other side, as with the above description are the seemingly arbitrary laws.\n",

      "Then positive (human) law is the same as described above. So, yeah, you've described what a lot of people think Catholics, Evangelicals and Calvinists believe about salvation, but, if you want to know what we do believe you should either ask three separate questions to that effect or read the Eschewmenical Blog from July wherein those three traditions are defended.  But like many other rules concerning the permenant diaconate, the family commitment to the deacons ordination process is up to the diocesan bishop.  Furthermore, a wife must be give her consent that her husband become a deacon. Parsonage is a is a Protestant term, now, either he's just using the wrong word there, which is understandable or he's referring to someone else,  if it were Catholic, we'd call it a Rectory, not a parsonage. I don't think he didn't wrote deliberately Catholic stories like the Grimm brothers did, but I'm not an expert and have read more Grimm's Fairy Tales than his.  I'd prefer a Catholic answer, and not one that challenges my premises either!

      "The xvYCC encoding is, as far as I can tell, a modern enhancement to YCC encoding, or in its long form, Y'CbCr (or YCbCr, which is slightly different.) The YCC encoding is part of a family of luminance/chrominance color spaces, which are all largely rooted in the Lab* ('Lab' for short) color space formulated by CIE back in the 1930's. The Lab color space is also a Luminance/Chrominance color space, wherein the luminance of a color is encoded in the L* value, while two chrominance axes of a color are encoded in the a* and b* values. The a* value encodes one half of the chrominance along the green/magenta axis, while the b* value encodes the other half of the chrominance along the blue/yellow axis. These two color axes were chosen to mimic and represent the four color primary sensitivities of the human eye, which also lie along a red/green and blue/yellow pair of axes (although true human eyesight involves a double-peak red curve, with the smaller peak occurring in the middle of the blue curve, which actually means the human eye is directly sensitive to magenta, not red...hence the green/magenta axis in Lab.)\n",
      "The YUV Encoding\n",
      "Y'CbCr is probably most prominently recognized in the form of YUV video encoding. The YUV encoding was specifically designed to reduce the amount of space necessary to encode color for video transmission, back in the days when bandwidth was a rather scarce commodity. Transmitting color information as RGB triplets is wasteful, since R,G,B triplets encode color with a fair amount of redundancy: all three components include luminance information as well as chrominance information, and luminance is weighted across all three components. YUV is a low-bandwidth form of Y'CbCr luminance/chrominance color encoding that does not have the wasteful redundancy of RGB encoding. YUV can consume anywhere from 2/3 down to 1/4 the bandwidth of a full RGB signal depending on the subsampling format (and, additionally, it stored the full detail image in the distinct luminance channel Y, which conveniently supported both B&W as well as Color TV signals with a single encoding format.) It should be clearly noted that YCC is not really a color space, rather it is a way of encoding RGB color information. I think a more accurate term would be a color model than a color space, and the term color model can be applied to both RGB and YUV.\n",
      "From the reference linked in the original question, it appears that xvYCC is an enhanced form of Y'CbCr encoding that stores encoded luminance/chrominance color information with more bits than YUV. Instead of encoding luminance and chrominance in interleaved sets of 2-4 bits, xvYCC encodes color in modern 10-bit values. \n",
      "Use in Still Photography\n",
      "Intriguingly enough, there is one DSLR camera brand that does use something very similar. Canon added a new RAW format to their cameras in recent years, called sRAW. While a normal RAW image contains a direct bayer dump of full sensor data, sRAW is actually not a true RAW image format. The sRAW format does not contain bayer data, it contains processed Y'CbCr content interpolated from the underlying bayer RGBG pixel data. Similar to the TV days, sRAW aims to use more original signal information to encode luminance and chrominance data in a high precision (14-bpc), but space-saving, image format. An sRAW image can be anywhere from 40-60% the size of a RAW image, and the gains are realized by a similar interleaving and sharing of luminance information amongst multiple chrominance pairs (similar to how RGBG bayer pixels are shared to generate actual RGB pixels.)\n",
      "The benefit of sRAW is that you maintain high human-perceptual color accuracy in a compact file format, and make better use of the RGBG pixels on the bayer sensor (rather than overlapped sampling that produces nasty color moire, sRAW performs non-overlapped chrominance sampling and overlapped/distributed luminance sampling.) The drawback is that it is not a true RAW format, and color information is interpolated and downsampled from the full bayer sensor. If you do not need the full RAW resolution of the camera (i.e. you only intend to print at 8x10 or 11x16), then sRAW can be a real benefit, as it can save a lot on space (as much as 60% savings over RAW), it saves faster than raw providing a higher frame rate, and makes better use of color information captured by the sensor than full resolution RAW.\n",

      "Intriguingly enough, there is one DSLR camera brand that does use something very similar. Canon added a new RAW format to their cameras in recent years, called sRAW. While a normal RAW image contains a direct bayer dump of full sensor data, sRAW is actually not a true RAW image format. The sRAW format does not contain bayer data, it contains processed Y'CbCr content interpolated from the underlying bayer RGBG pixel data. Similar to the TV days, sRAW aims to use more original signal information to encode luminance and chrominance data in a high precision (14-bpc), but space-saving, image format. An sRAW image can be anywhere from 40-60% the size of a RAW image, and the gains are realized by a similar interleaving and sharing of luminance information amongst multiple chrominance pairs (similar to how RGBG bayer pixels are shared to generate actual RGB pixels.)\n",
      "The benefit of sRAW is that you maintain high human-perceptual color accuracy in a compact file format, and make better use of the RGBG pixels on the bayer sensor (rather than overlapped sampling that produces nasty color moire, sRAW performs non-overlapped chrominance sampling and overlapped/distributed luminance sampling.) The drawback is that it is not a true RAW format, and color information is interpolated and downsampled from the full bayer sensor. If you do not need the full RAW resolution of the camera (i.e. you only intend to print at 8x10 or 11x16), then sRAW can be a real benefit, as it can save a lot on space (as much as 60% savings over RAW), it saves faster than raw providing a higher frame rate, and makes better use of color information captured by the sensor than full resolution RAW.\n",

      "But suppose we also develop theories that explain Y and Z - and there's no conflict between our theories. Better yet, suppose these different theories appear to support each other.\n",
      "If you have literally thousands of theories that explain countless phenomena, and everything appears to fit together, then you've created what you might call a framework. Now, let's say we take one of your \"infinite number of other theories\" and plug it into X. Even if it appears to be a tenable theory in isolation, does it mesh with all the theories explaining other phenomena?\n",
      "Things like electricity, the internal combustion engine and medical science aren't just a function of theory; they have to actually work - and they do work. So why would anyone want to rewire a country's electrical grid based on some whimsical philosophical theory?\n",
      "Only a fool would suggest that science is 100% accurate, and, in a philosophical vein, one might question everything science has taught us. But when it's time to eat, get dressed or buy a home, most people are going to trust science over philosophy.\n",
      "Which isn't to say they're in competition. I subscribe to the view that philosophy is a tool or discipline that helps us understand things that scientists can't examine. To put it another way, science might be thought of as the study of the known, while philosophy is the study of the unknown. Humans are animals and are born neither good nor evil. \"Good\" behavior is generally taught or imitated. It begins with learning to follow one's parents' rules (e.g. don't hit), then society's rules. Eventually, one must learn to follow the state's rules. Empathy allows us to effectively extend goodness, caring for people on the other side of the world or even other species (generally \"sentient\" species). \"Bad\" behavior consists of either breaking the rules or knowingly doing something that hurts another individual or even another species (e.g. kicking a dog). Sure, it's possible, but there are limitations. Levitating people sounds a little far-fetched, for example.\n",
      "There were a couple philosophers named Hobbes and Rousseau who had very different ideas about Nature and \"progress.\" Hobbes thought man's natural state was brutish, while Rousseau was more of a romanticist who thought progress degraded people.\n",

      "My natural inclination is to side with Rousseau. Unfortunately, I couldn't survive without electricity and ice cream.\n",
      "In the end, it's a balancing act. There's no question that technology has affected us in both positive and negative ways. But some would argue \"What's so bad about a physically disabled person (who would have been eaten by predators thousands of years ago) who's a guru of astro-physics?\" Ultimately, the ethical ramifications of revenge are a reflection of your personal moral code. However, if you even entertain thoughts of revenge, you might want to be careful about sharing them publicly, because most people will condemn you. \n",

      "If you have literally thousands of theories that explain countless phenomena, and everything appears to fit together, then you've created what you might call a framework. Now, let's say we take one of your \"infinite number of other theories\" and plug it into X. Even if it appears to be a tenable theory in isolation, does it mesh with all the theories explaining other phenomena?\n",
      "Things like electricity, the internal combustion engine and medical science aren't just a function of theory; they have to actually work - and they do work. So why would anyone want to rewire a country's electrical grid based on some whimsical philosophical theory?\n",
      "Only a fool would suggest that science is 100% accurate, and, in a philosophical vein, one might question everything science has taught us. But when it's time to eat, get dressed or buy a home, most people are going to trust science over philosophy.\n",
      "Which isn't to say they're in competition. I subscribe to the view that philosophy is a tool or discipline that helps us understand things that scientists can't examine. To put it another way, science might be thought of as the study of the known, while philosophy is the study of the unknown. Humans are animals and are born neither good nor evil. \"Good\" behavior is generally taught or imitated. It begins with learning to follow one's parents' rules (e.g. don't hit), then society's rules. Eventually, one must learn to follow the state's rules. Empathy allows us to effectively extend goodness, caring for people on the other side of the world or ev en other species (generally \"sentient\" species). \"Bad\" behavior consists of either breaking the rules or knowingly doing something that hurts another individual or even another species (e.g. kicking a dog). Sure, it's possible, but there are limitations. Levitating people sounds a little far-fetched, for example.\n",
      "There were a couple philosophers named Hobbes and Rousseau who had very different ideas about Nature and \"progress.\" Hobbes thought man's natural state was brutish, while Rousseau was more of a romanticist who thought progress degraded people.\n",
      "I believe another philosopher named Locke was somewhere in the middle.\n",
      "My natural inclination is to side with Rousseau. Unfortunately, I couldn't survive without electricity and ice cream.\n",
      "In the end, it's a balancing act. There's no question that technology has affected us in both positive and negative ways. But some would argue \"What's so bad about a physically disabled person (who would have been eaten by predators thousands of years ago) who's a guru of astro-physics?\" Ultimately, the ethical ramifications of revenge are a reflection of your personal moral code. However, if you even entertain thoughts of revenge, you might want to be careful about sharing them publicly, because most people will condemn you. \n",
      "I'm new to philosophy, too, so bear with me.\n",
      "You asked,  Science - focus on facts, logic and theory; yields proven facts\n",
      "Philosophy - greater focus on logic; yields philosophical theories and doctrines\n",
      "Spirituality - largely intuitive; yields a feeling of being connected with the  universe that's very hard to explain or quantify; generally a much more personal, even solitary experience than science or even philosophy\n",
      "Religion - primarily faith-based and very politicized; used as a form of mind control to a far greater degree than science, philosophy or spirituality, though all can be subverted by propagandists\n",

      "para_text: Nor will this: Before I can really answer your question about ETTR, my first question is: \n",
      "What camera do you have? \n",
      "If you have a Canon camera, then you do need to pay much closer attention to what range of tones you are preserving in your photos. Technically speaking, \"correct\" ETTR means you NEVER throw away any highlights. There are various schools of thought on that, and in some cases, throwing away some highlights may be acceptable, and if there is shadow detail that is more important than those highlights, the simple logical conclusion is to throw away the highlights. For purists, that would be going beyond ETTR, but in general, I think you do what you have to in order to produce the photo you want...and if that means throwing away highlights, and you are consciously making that decision, then its an entirely acceptable option.\n",
      "Is there such a thing as ETTL? Personally, I don't think ETTL is a viable concept. We are talking about signals here...to be more specific, we are talking about digital signals and SNR. In a digital signal that is produced by an image sensor, you have a pretty hard cutoff at the point where highlights clip. This is due to the nature of how the signal in each pixel is read out and converted to a digital number. The analog response of the sensor itself may not be linear throughout the entire range of it's literal sensitivity, however most camera manufacturers limit the \"usable\" range of charge to within the largely linear response, and any signal beyond the range of linear response at the high end is simply clipped to white. \n",
      "When it comes to shadows...fundamentally, shadows are not clipped, not by any natural consequence of sensor design. Some manufacturers in the past (Nikon and Sony) have chosen to clip a little bit of the blacks, however both manufacturers these days use a bias offset of around 600 now. The key problem with shadows is they get lost in noise. \n",
      "So when you create a photograph with a digital camera...you have either clipped the highlights, or not. When it comes to preserving highlights, so long as you understand your camera and have a good feel for where it clips, you preserve highlights simply by not clipping them. That does not require ETTL per se...it simply requires paying careful attention to how far the highlights extend in your histogram. (For Canon cameras, adding MagicLantern, and using it's RAW histogram, can GREATLY help in this area.) So long as you don't push your highlights beyond the point where they clip, there is nothing else you need to do to preserve them. They are all preserved. That's it. \n",
      "The entire reason ETTR exists is because in the highlights, and in the midtones, the signal is strong enough that the SNR is acceptably high. You have low noise because noise is the square root of the signal. The square root of something grows more slowly than that something itself. If your signal is 10,000e-, your noise is 100e-, which also so happens to be a ratio (or SNR) of 100:1. If your signal is 100,000e-, your noise is 316e-, an SNR of 316:1. It's in the shadows where noise can become a problem. A signal of 1000e- has noise of 31e-, which is an SNR of a \"mere\" 31:1. A signal of 1000e- is actually fairly strong...that is actually probably more like low midtones or brighter shadows in most cases. True shadows can be as little as 50e-, and deep shadows can be as little as 10-15e-! There you have very low SNR.\n",
      "The problem with shadows is compounded by electronic noise, however. There is noise inherent in every signal, but with a digital camera, you also have added electronic noise. Read noise, as it is usually termed, is compounded with (added to in quadrature) the noise in the signal. If your camera has 30e- RMS read noise, and your signal is 50e-, then your SNR is not 50/SQRT(50), it is 50/SQRT(50 + 30^2)!! That is a minut SNR of 1.62:1! A Canon 5D III has MORE than 30e- read noise at ISO 100. (Which should explain why it's detail in the shadows breaks down and becomes unusable with a mere 3-4 stop push above.) \n",
      "If on the other hand, you have a mere 3e- RMS read noise, and your signal is 50e-, then your SNR is 50/SQRT(50+3^2), which gives you an SNR of 6.51:1. An SNR of 6.5:1 is actually fairly decent for shadows. (As an astrophotographer, I often work with SNRs smaller than that.) The Sony A7r, and for that matter, the A7 and A7 II, the A6000, the Nikon D800, 810, 600, 610, 750, the 7000 line, the 5000 line since the 5100, the 3000 line since the 3100, etc. all have read noise in the range of about 3e- or less (regardless of ISO). The Samsung NX1 has read noise around 5e-. (There are new sensors being tested that have constant read noise as little as 1.5e- and less at base gain!) If you have any one of these cameras, then careful and meticulous ETTR becomes less of a necessity. ETTR is still recommended, it's just good practice to make the best use of your sensor's dynamic range as you can, but you don't have to be as concerned about pushing it to the utter limits, carefully preserving highlights, while gaining as much signal as possible in the shadows. The shadows will, as you can see from the above, handle SIGNIFICANT pushing in post, and with some effort to restore some contrast to the scene after a heavy shadow push and even a little bit of NR, can largely negate the need to really worry about ETTR beyond generally shifting your exposures to the right...without clipping highlights. \n",

      "Artificial light sources do not necessarily emit a broad spectrum, and rarely emit a \"full\" spectrum, nor do they always emit a continuous spectrum for the range they cover. The quality or fidelity of color and detail that we see from a lit subject is very dependent upon the breadth and continuity of the light that illuminates it. Artificial lighting also generally tends to have an unnatural wavelength distribution, in that its spectral curve will usually peak either too warm or too cool relative to sunlight, producing the shifted white balance that requires correction in post. If your working with tungsten (halogen) lighting, your working with a very narrow band of mostly continuous, but very warm light. Some subjects will appear just fine under such lighting with white-balance correction in post, as they primarily respond to more redshifted wavelengths of light. Other subjects, however, may lack detail and color fidelity when lit by tungsten light because they primarily respond to more blueshifted wavelengths of light.\n",
      "While some forms of artificial light offer a more broad spectrum, there are usually either limitations to their bandwidth, or there may be holes and gaps in the spectrum emitted. Lights based on black-body emission, or in other words light sources that emit light by heating some kind of element (usually meta), will usually provide more continuous spectrum lighting that has more limited bandwidth. Lights based on gas emission, or in other words light sources that emit light by passing an electric current through a gas of some kind, will often provide broad bandwidth but spotty continuity (lots of gaps). Neither form  of lighting is perfect, although many specialized types of lights greatly mitigate the negatives while enhancing the positives...such as providing as broad a spectrum as possible with as few gaps as possible. Attach the Lee filter adapter ring to lens. Set camera to Manual mode.\n",

      "It would really depend on what UV filter you used. Not all UV filters are created equal, and even ones that are supposedly \"high-end\" might not function correctly, while some cheaper ones function quite well. \n",
      "The ultimate goal of a UV filter is to filter out ultraviolet light, which starts around 380nm, and progresses on down to as small as 100nm or so. A quality UV filter will usually stop \"filtering\" right around 380nm, and be mostly transparent to all other wavelengths of light after that. A poorly designed UV filter may also filter some blue light, and may gradually taper off \"filtering\" up to around 420nm or so. Really poor UV filters will often also filter some amount of all wavelengths of light, some more green than others, acting as a very slight ND filter as well.\n",
      "This article provides an excellent review of numerous UV filters. It is a little dated, however its process is very solid, and it covers how well each filter blocks just UV light (or not).\n",
      "Your Canon T3i is a DSLR, so you do not really need to use a UV filter unless you really need to block excess UV light (most CMOS sensors are sensitive to some degree of UV light, however normal glass as used in camera lenses tends to block most of it.) You can always change the \"White Balance\" setting of your camera and adjust it more for an orange tint (lower K number). If you would prefer to optically control the color balance of your photos, you could use skylight or coral filters. Skylight filters come in several degrees of tint and will \"cool\" the tone of light (make it more blueish), while coral filters which also come in several degrees of tint will \"warm\" the tone of light (make it more orangeish.) Skylight and Coral filters are really a thing of the past these days, as many of the limitations of film no longer exist with digital cameras. \n",
      "I would think that a lab's color-correcting quality is dependent upon the lab and the skill of the technicians. There probably is not a single, globally correct answer here, as every lab will use different equipment and have different people with different levels of skill. That said, when it comes to color correction for print, taking the paper into account can have a keen impact on the quality of printed color.\n",
      "I would say that if  you give the job of color-correcting an image to someone else, you are always giving up your own personal creativity and style. A lab can't really know how you want your photos to look, and regardless of how skilled the technician may be, they will only be able to make a print look good according to their own vision. If you want to have as accurate a color as you can, you could try asking for ICC color profiles for the lab's print gear and paper, and use Photoshop's soft-proofing to ensure that tonal range is bound to the range of the paper, and that your photo does not include any out-of-gamut colors.\n",
      "Black point in particular can be a key factor in determining if a print renders subtle shade nuances correctly or not, and that can affect the overall appearance of the image. Blocked blacks can suck up a lot of fine detail that may be important. It can result in an increased level of contrast that is undesired. Sometimes you need to choose a paper that is capable of achieving the contrast you desire, as some papers simply can't support high contrast without losing important detail while others can. \n",
      "Some papers, particularly fine art papers, often have odd gamut boundaries, and highly saturated colors are often out of gamut. When printed without manual correction, colors may shift, or they may simply be clipped, resulting in odd gradations or unexpected tonally flat areas. Inks used can also be a factor here, and if you have photos with particularly saturated colors, you may want to make sure the printers use inks capable of achieving a wide enough gamut to accommodate your needs. Gamut issues like that can be difficult to correct without affecting the rest of a photo. Correcting such issues with a single specific goal (i.e. always balancing for skin tones) can sometimes have detrimental effects to other parts of a photo that may affect the rendition of your personal style. If your photos are not portraits, correcting for skin tones can have a severe impact on the quality of color, such as mainly green landscapes, or landscapes with richly saturated sunsets and the like.\n",
      "If you want to end up with a print that fits your personal style and vision, it is probably best to request an ICC profile and use the soft-proofing features of Photoshop to identify problem areas at the very least. If you have the option of correcting those problem areas, and having a small-scale print made (i.e. an 8x10 or something like that) to see if your corrections result in the outcome you desire, you'll have the best results. If you do not really have a specific style in mind, you could probably get away with having a lab do color correction for you. Again, it might be best to see if the lab can send you a smaller size sample print before spending big bucks on a larger print or a set of prints. \n",
      "The key difference between the two is that one works on a post-digitized image, where as the other works on the pre-digitized analog signal. Whenever you work with an analog signal, you have the ability to be more precise and accurate, and can eliminate noise before it is \"burned into\" a digitized image. Thats most certainly not to say that applying noise reduction post-digitization is ineffective. On the contrary, with advanced algorithms, such as a well-informed wavelet deconvolution, noise reduction in post can be extremely effective. There are some things that hardware noise reduction can do that software noise reduction can't, or simply can't be as effective at, though.\n",
      "Types of Hardware Noise\n",
      "The key area where hardware noise reduction is most effective is in reducing electronic noise. This is the noise introduced by the electronics themselves and during sensor readout, and is primarily responsible for the unsightly, unnatural patterned forms of noise: read noise, fixed-pattern noise (fpn), dynamic pattern noise/horizontal and vertical banding noise, and non-uniform response noise (or pixel response non-uniformity noise, PRNU). These forms of noise are extremely difficult to remove with software unless the software knows the exact characteristics of each specific sensor. Such an algorithm would require a considerable amount of support data to function...for each and every sensor it needed to work with. As such, it is far more effective to remove these types of noise directly in hardware.\n",
      "Each type of noise introduced by the electronics of the sensor or by the readout process can be compensated for, in some cases entirely, in others mostly. There are a variety of sources of this noise. Dark current, the electric current passing through the sensor circuits, is responsible for putting a limit on low signal level as it often \"adds\" a few electrons of its own to each pixel that weren't generated by photon conversion. As its only a few electrons worth, it only affects IQ in very low-signal areas, but that can mean the difference between having or not having one to two full stops of additional dynamic range.\n",
      "Fixed pattern noise is an intrinsic property of each sensor, and differs from sensor to sensor. Some pixels run \"hot\", while others run \"cool\". Hotter pixels again tend to introduce more electrons to the pixel, on top of whatever may be added by dark current. These differences are often the result of microscopic manufacturing nuances, and are difficult to control. FPN often shows up in unchanging horizontal and vertical striations, often lending to the type of highly undesired types of noise photographers loath. \n",
      "Dynamic pattern noise, or banding, also often exhibits in horizontal and vertical bands. There can be a variety of causes for banding, from fluctuations of current running through the sensor to external signal interference in a poorly shielded sensor. Since this type of pattern noise is dynamic, it can be nearly impossible to remove in post as it changes from frame to frame. It tends to be a fairly weak aspect of noise, though, and it tends to occur at a very low signal level, so it is usually only visible in very deep shadows.\n",
      "Noise due to non-uniform response has to do with very slight differences in quantum efficiency between pixels. The quantum efficiency (Q.E.) of a sensor may fall within a certain percentage range, however there are usually still very slight differences between a given pixel and the pixels that surround it. There can also be slight differences in analog gain for each pixel's amplifier, which can introduce further slight counting error.\n",
      "Hardware Noise Reduction\n",
      "Most of the types of noise above can be controlled, and either eliminated or greatly mitigated. The most common form of hardware noise reduction is Correlated Double Sampling (CDS). Canon, Nikon, and Sony sensors all use some form of CDS. The general idea is that a separate part of the circuit for each pixel measures how much noise dark current introduces during readout. Before reading the pixel, dark current charge is read (sampled), then the full pixel well is sampled, and the difference between the two is kept as the actual pixel signal.\n",
      "Most sensors don't employ much more in the way of hardware-level noise reduction. In the case of Sony's new Exmor sensor brand, a variety of additional hardware noise reduction mechanisms are utilized. Non-uniform response is handled by additional circuitry that compensates for differential in Q.E. between neighboring pixels. This balances out the Q.E. of all pixels in general, producing a much more uniform response to the final image signal. To combat the some FPN, Sony also employs Column-Parallel Analog-to-Digital Conversion (CP-ADC). \n",
      "ADC is generally the culprit for \"read noise\", where additional signal noise as well as quantization noise is introduced to the analog image signal as it is digitized. Part of this is due to the high speed of ADC units...which are normally off of the sensor die and housed in an external image processing chip. Most cameras utilize some form of parallel ADC, however there are considerably fewer ADC's than rows or columns of pixels. They must operate at a fairly high frequency to convert enough pixels to maintain the cameras frame rate, and higher frequency circuits tend to introduce more read noise. CP-ADC moves the ADC onto the sensor die, and adds one ADC unit per pixel column. This allows each ADC to operate at a far lower frequency, greatly mitigating the amount of read noise introduced. It hyperparallelizes the read pipeline, improving overall sensor readout rate (theoretically...we have yet to see a Sony Exmor sensor capable of faster readout than a Canon sensor.) Finally, each ADC can be tuned to mitigate vertical banding in its column, helping mitigate fixed pattern noise that exhibits as banding.\n",
      "Benefits of Hardware Noise Reduction\n",
      "Due to its multiple levels of hardware noise reduction, Sony Exmor sensors are far less succeptible to electronic and read noise. They still suffer from a small amount, and microscopic manufacturing defects still cause per-pixel fixed pattern noise resulting in \"hot\" red, green, and blue pixels. The impact is only a couple electrons worth in most cases, as most dark current and vertical and horizontal fixed pattern noise is eliminated by their additional noise reduction circuitry. Read noise is reduced by ADC's that operate at a slower frequency in parallel. This leads to a signal floor well below most other manufacturers (including those for medium format sensors), which can fall anywhere from 8 to 35 electrons worth of read noise at ISO 100.\n",
      "Most might think this simply leads to less noise. In general, it does not. It only leads to less electronic and read noise, which, even at 30+ electrons worth, is still a very tiny fraction of maximum signal. In APS-C sensors maximum signal ranges from around 15,000 to 30,000 electrons per pixel. In FF sensors maximum signal ranges from 60,000 to around 100,000 electrons per pixel, possibly even more for sensors that have a particularly large pixel pitch. The vast bulk of image noise comes from photon shot noise. This is noise due to the random nature of light, such that photons are not guaranteed to evenly distribute over the sensor and produce smooth gradients and smooth solids. Removal of random photon shot noise is a realm where wavelet deconvolution excels, so the use of software noise removal is still a critical component of noise removal in general.\n",
      "The true benefit of hardware noise reduction is less in the mitigation of noise, and more to the benefit of dynamic range. By reducing electronic and read noise from dozens of electrons to around 2.8 electrons per pixel, dynamic range in low-signal regions of an image can be greatly improved. This is the primary reason that Nikon's D7000, D800, and D3200 are able to achieve over 13 stops of dynamic range while Canon sensors are barely able to achieve 11 stops, and have never achieved more than 12 stops, of dynamic range.\n",
      "Benefits of Software Noise Reduction\n",
      "Finally, software noise reduction has its place, and its just as important as hardware noise reduction. No matter how good your hardware noise reduction, there will always be some amount of noise in a photograph. At the very least, ADC tends to introduce some degree of quantization error due to non-scalar gain. If gain is 1.4, that means every 1.4 electrons results in one level of digital output. Since you can't convert .4 electrons, ADC will oscillate between reading one electron as a single digital level, and reading two electrons as a single digital level. This produces a slight amount of noise that is usually termed \"read noise\". Its largely insignificant, but it can be minimally observed while pixel peeping.\n",
      "The higher the signal to noise ration, which can improve with improved Q.E., the less the random physical nature of light will cause visible noise. It will always cause some though, and it will always be most visible in areas of smoother tone below a medium gray tone (18% gray). Cranking up ISO also increases the effect photon shot noise has on an image. Regardless of the efficiency of the sensor, photography at high ISO will always be noisier than at low ISO. This is due to the fact that sensors are actually fixed response analog devices that sense light in a linear fashion. Increasing ISO does not actually increase sensitivity. On the contrary, it simply reduces the electron count that is considered \"maximum saturation\". If your full-frame sensor is capable of registering 100000 electrons at ISO 100, it will be capable of registering 50000 electrons at ISO 200, 25000 at ISO 400, 12500 at ISO 800, 6250 at ISO 1600, etc. Beyond ISO 400, your always working with a signal that, from a linear standpoint, is below medium gray, and simply amplifying it. The farther you push ISO after that point, the more pronounced photon shot noise will become.\n",
      "When it comes to dealing with predictably random noise, such as that caused by photon shot noise and introduced by the ADC, software algorithms excel. One of the best forms of noise removal for this type of noise are various Wavelet Deconvolution algorithms that are fairly good at predicting the random distribution of photons. Most noise reduction algorithms in commercial software seem to work according to less advanced concepts than wavelet deconvolution, so noise removal is currently less effective in general than it probably could be. Hopefully we'll see more advanced noise removal algorithms introduced into commercial software in the future, with the hope that random noise can be mitigated nearly entirely without affecting useful, real detail.\n",
      "Simple answer over, on to the specifics.\n",
      "Artificial light sources do not necessarily emit a broad spectrum, and rarely emit a \"full\" spectrum, nor do they always emit a continuous spectrum for the range they cover. The quality or fidelity of color and detail that we see from a lit subject is very dependent upon the breadth and continuity of the light that illuminates it. Artificial lighting also generally tends to have an unnatural wavelength distribution, in that its spectral curve will usually peak either too warm or too cool relative to sunlight, producing the shifted white balance that requires correction in post. If your working with tungsten (halogen) lighting, your working with a very narrow band of mostly continuous, but very warm light. Some subjects will appear just fine under such lighting with white-balance correction in post, as they primarily respond to more redshifted wavelengths of light. Other subjects, however, may lack detail and color fidelity when lit by tungsten light because they primarily respond to more blueshifted wavelengths of light.\n",
      "While some forms of artificial light offer a more broad spectrum, there are usually either limitations to their bandwidth, or there may be holes and gaps in the spectrum emitted. Lights based on black-body emission, or in other words light sources that emit light by heating some kind of element (usually meta), will usually provide more continuous spectrum lighting that has more limited bandwidth. Lights based on gas emission, or in other words light sources that emit light by passing an electric current through a gas of some kind, will often provide broad bandwidth but spotty continuity (lots of gaps). Neither form  of lighting is perfect, although many specialized types of lights greatly mitigate the negatives while enhancing the positives...such as providing as broad a spectrum as possible with as few gaps as possible. Attach the Lee filter adapter ring to lens. Set camera to Manual mode.\n",

      "It would really depend on what UV filter you used. Not all UV filters are created equal, and even ones that are supposedly \"high-end\" might not function correctly, while some cheaper ones function quite well. \n",
      "The ultimate goal of a UV filter is to filter out ultraviolet light, which starts around 380nm, and progresses on down to as small as 100nm or so. A quality UV filter will usually stop \"filtering\" right around 380nm, and be mostly transparent to all other wavelengths of light after that. A poorly designed UV filter may also filter some blue light, and may gradually taper off \"filtering\" up to around 420nm or so. Really poor UV filters will often also filter some amount of all wavelengths of light, some more green than others, acting as a very slight ND filter as well.\n",
      "This article provides an excellent review of numerous UV filters. It is a little dated, however its process is very solid, and it covers how well each filter blocks just UV light (or not).\n",
      "Your Canon T3i is a DSLR, so you do not really need to use a UV filter unless you really need to block excess UV light (most CMOS sensors are sensitive to some degree of UV light, however normal glass as used in camera lenses tends to block most of it.) You can always change the \"White Balance\" setting of your camera and adjust it more for an orange tint (lower K number). If you would prefer to optically control the color balance of your photos, you could use skylight or coral filters. Skylight filters come in several degrees of tint and will \"cool\" the tone of light (make it more blueish), while coral filters which also come in several degrees of tint will \"warm\" the tone of light (make it more orangeish.) Skylight and Coral filters are really a thing of the past these days, as many of the limitations of film no longer exist with digital cameras. \n",
      "I would think that a lab's color-correcting quality is dependent upon the lab and the skill of the technicians.

      "On paper, you start off with Elf, then you apply everything that Half-Dragon says to apply.\n",
      "So you are an elf, that is half-dragon. Roleplaying-wise you would indeed be \"half-elf/half-dragon.\" But unless you start off as Half-Elf as a base creature, you don't get to enjoy what half-elves get. \n",

      "The only difference between the two systems, regarding ranged pins and sunders and whatnot, would be CMB vs. CMD in Pathfinder which of course doesn't exist in D&D 3.5e.\n",
      "Otherwise, the mechanics are the same. Touch attacks are touch attacks, and ranged touch attacks are ranged touch attacks. Opinion\n",

      "Although there is no specific account of Bahamut being referenced to as a dragon before Gary Gygax came about, we can certainly learn what his influences were. And Dragons of old were known as Wyrms and/or Serpents.\n",
      "Dragons weren't always called dragons.\n",
      "Therefore, we could safely say that bahamut was very possibly regarded as a dragon; knowing all the different terms used for dragons in antiquity.\n",
      "Was he a platinum dragon? There appear to be no accounts of Bahamut's color mentioned. Especially the color of platinum. That is very possibly a creation of Gary Gygax indeed.\n",
      "The similarities between cultures and continents are in-line with other mythos; parallels between religious myths across the world for example. Without being able to ask Gary Gygax himself... Question(s) This appears contrary to what the SRD states about Damage Reduction: Same as above, for Arcane casting specifically (e.g. Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard).  \n",
      "Typical Undead when reduced to 0 hit points or less, they are immediately destroyed.\n",
      "Vampires are not typical undead, however; reducing a vampire’s hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesn’t always destroy it1. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, it automatically assumes gaseous form and attempts to escape.\n",
      "The magic item2 should allow you to act normally at 0 HP, meaning, you don't automatically assume gaseous form. However, the rule regarding all undead at 0 hit points, mean being destroyed.

      "TL;DR\n",
      "On paper, you start off with Elf, then you apply everything that Half-Dragon says to apply.\n",
      "So you are an elf, that is half-dragon. Roleplaying-wise you would indeed be \"half-elf/half-dragon.\" But unless you start off as Half-Elf as a base creature, you don't get to enjoy what half-elves get. \n",
      "No.\n",
      "The spell would state that the creatures would become blinded if that were the case.\n",
      "For example:\n",
      "Blindness/Deafness However, don't forget to \"recharge your batteries first.\" Mounts use the actions of the rider. PF vs. D&D 3.5e\n",
      "The only difference between the two systems, regarding ranged pins and sunders and whatnot, would be CMB vs. CMD in Pathfinder which of course doesn't exist in D&D 3.5e.\n",
      "Otherwise, the mechanics are the same. Touch attacks are touch attacks, and ranged touch attacks are ranged touch attacks. Opinion\n",
      "It may not be gamebreaking - since you would pour through your Legend Points very quickly if used in such a manner. Speak with the storyteller and come to an agreement.\n",
      "Source\n",
      "Scion: Hero (White Wolf Publishing) There are a few inconsistencies within the text of the feat that is now confusing me a little. It says \"Choose one of the creature's natural attack forms.\" Rend would indeed be a natural attack form (wouldn't it?). But then it says right after it, \"the damage for this natural weapon [...],\" Rend isn't listed under the 'types' of natural weapons in the SRD: Apply the Stone Hand graft. Book of Job, King James Version \n",
      "It would require a DM ruling.\n",
      "The developers didn't create a bullet point for every 'what if' scenario available. Some were added after the fact, hence Dragon magazine. If you want to have a bloodline that falls out of the published material provided, who would arbitrate the bloodlines from other animals? It would have to be your DM. \n",

      "Immediate Action In summary\n",
      "Although there is no specific account of Bahamut being referenced to as a dragon before Gary Gygax came about, we can certainly learn what his influences were. And Dragons of old were known as Wyrms and/or Serpents.\n",
      "Dragons weren't always called dragons.\n",
      "Therefore , we could safely say that bahamut was very possibly regarded as a dragon; knowing all the different terms used for dragons in antiquity.\n",
      "Was he a platinum dragon? There appear to be no accounts of Bahamut's color mentioned. Especially the color of platinum. That is very possibly a creation of Gary Gygax indeed.\n",
      "The similarities between cultures and continents are in-line with other mythos; parallels between religious myths across the world for example. Without being able to ask Gary Gygax himself... Question(s) This appears contrary to what the SRD states about Damage Reduction: Same as above, for Arcane casting specifically (e.g. Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard).  \n",
      "Typical Undead when reduced to 0 hit points or less, they are immediately destroyed.\n",
      "Vampires are not typical undead, however; reducing a vampire’s hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesn’t always destroy it1. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, it automatically assumes gaseous form and attempts to escape.\n",
      "The magic item2 should allow you to act normally at 0 HP, meaning, you don't automatically assume gaseous form. However, the rule regarding all undead at 0 hit points, mean being destroyed. Undead don't have a negative hit point threshold. So acting normally in this regard, would simply mean destruction - that is what would normally happen if there was no automatic gaseous form taking place. \n",
      "Undead3 are not subject to non-lethal damage so there is no benefit for them regarding not being staggered.\n",

Attitudes like that are not acceptable.  Parents want to protect their children from harm and they may need to push to get help.

Attitudes like that are not acceptable.  Parents want to protect their children from harm and they may need to push to get help.

There are three types of leadership skills, those that increase your personal ability to command a number of people, those that give bonuses when you are a booster, and those that increase the effectiveness of Warfare Link modules.

      "Overloading gives a different bonus based on which type of module you are overloading. It 'improves' the function of the module by a specific amount, increasing the effect. The drawback is that the modules heat up, dealing an amount of damage per cycle.

Thus, I strongly recommend against doing this without making $n$ at least 64-128 bits longer than $m$. If you want to see a work where small biases are used to recover plaintext, then Analysing and Exploiting the Mantin Biases in RC4 is a good place to start. \n",
      "OT is typically not used as an application in its own right. In the context of access control, OT limits the number of messages received by B but not which messages. I don't know of any real applications for this (you could talk about a subscription where B has purchased the right to read any $k$ articles, but this is pretty artificial in my opinion).\n",
      "However, OT is a very important and basic building block used in constructing secure computation protocols. It is used in generic protocols like Yao and GMW, and is often used in specific protocols for things like secure set intersection and others.\n",

      "The precise definition of a derivative security, in the framework used by Shreve is the following: let $S(t)$ denote a security or a family of securities (in the multidimensional market model, that is $S(t) = (S_1(t), \\cdots, S_n(t))$. Then a derivative security is determined at time $T$ by the condition of having a payoff $V(T)$, which can be expressed as $V(T)=g(S(T))$, with $g$ an $\\mathcal{F}(T)$-measurable function. \n",
      "This is the mathematically correct definition, so that in particular for a European call option with strike $K$ you have $g(x)=(x-K)^+$, and so on. Now, look at the proof of Theorem 5.4.9. in this case you have a payoff defined as $V(T)=\\mathbf{1}_A\\cdot (D(T))^{-1}$. In this case the security $S(T)$ is just $D(T)$, and $g(x)$ is measurable because $A$ is clearly an $\\mathcal{F}(T)$-measurable set. \n",

      "para_text: Let's take sRGB and AdobeRGB as color spaces, and 8-bit and 16-bit color as bit depths. sRGB is a small color space, while AdobeRGB is a larger color space. Color spaces, or gamuts, define the extent with which colors can be chosen from the entire range of color visible to the human eye (or, even, beyond that range, as would be the case with ProPhotoRGB or some of the new 10-bpc TV gamuts). If you map the color \"Pure Green\" in sRGB, that color will indeed be a numerically pure green...however it may not be the most perceptually accurate pure green. Map the same color \"Pure Green\" is AdobeRGB, and while numerically it is the same green, when mapped in AdobeRGB it's more saturated and vibrant. (Further, map the same color in ProPhotoRGB, and it will again be even more saturated than in AdobeRGB...assuming, of course, that the device your viewing this mapped color in is actually capable of achieving that level of color saturation...very few devices actually are.)\n",
      "Now, in comes bit depth. The difference between Pure Green in 8-bit and 16-bit is 0,255,0 vs. 0,65535,0. A much larger number is used to describe the green channel in pure green in 16-bit color than in 8-bit color. If we bring in a Medium Green, the value in 8-bit might be 0,128,0 while in 16-bit it would be 0,32768,0. Same color, but the number of distinct colors on the grade between Pure Green and Medium Green is far higher with 16-bit color. You have a total of 32768 distinct levels of green between those two levels in 16-bit, vs. a mere 128 distinct levels in 8-bit. Lets say we pick a lighter green, say 0,192,0 in 8-bit. That same color would be 0,49152,0 in 16-bit. This increase in potential distinct colors means that gradients become considerably smoother and more finely delineated when using a higher bit depth.\n",
      "Finally, how do bit depths and color spaces work together? With a narrow gamut, like sRGB, you have a restricted color space within which to map distinct colors. With sRGB and 8-bit color, each color is going to be truly distinct as you go through all the greens from from 0,1,0 through 0,128,0 to 0,255,0. What happens if you have a 16-bit image in the sRGB space? Numerically, your image has the ability to represent over 280 trillion distinct colors (16+16+16 bits is 48 bits total, 2^48 is 281.5 trillion). Perceptually...when numeric RGB values are mapped to gamut-restricted colors, a significant amount of that 280 trillion colors will end up getting mapped to the exact same \"color coordinate\" within the color space. Your image file still contains full precision color data, however when it is rendered to the screen (or rendered to print), the actual number of distinct colors is ultimately going to be limited by the color space.\n",
      "If we move up to AdobeRGB, the gamut grows, it's a larger color space and can therefor encompass a greater number of distinct color mappings. With an 8-bit color depth, your effectively going to be sparsely mapping into this larger gamut. Technically speaking, the gamut is capable of describing more colors than your bit depth is allowing you to reference. Your limiting factors have now swapped...instead of the gamut being restrictive, bit depth is being restrictive. If we go with 16-bit color in the AdobeRGB color space, there is more room for our 280 trillion potential colors to reference distinct colors. It's likely that multiple colors will still map to the same actual coordinates in AdobeRGB space, however there will be far fewer collisions in this larger space than with sRGB.\n",
      "So, while color space/gamut and bit depth are distinct things, they are interrelated. You are not required to use a larger gamut when using a higher bit depth to store your image data, however it is advisable to get the most out of that higher bit depth. Conversely, if you are saving images with a lower bit depth, there is often less value in rendering those images with anything more than sRGB. \n",
      "To fully take advantage of high bit depth color information in an image file, larger gamuts, and concurrently better screens that can actually display those gamuts, become valuable. To render 10, 12, and 16 bit color on TVs or computer screens, gamuts larger than AdobeRGB, and even larger than ProPhotoRGB, are often necessary to take full advantage of human visual perception. Our eyes are amazing devices, and capable of incredible dynamic range and extremely wide color sensitivity. Modern day 10-bit screens with 12-, 14-, and 16-bit hardware LUTs (3D Color Look Up Tables) are capable of displaying 1.07 billion concurrent colors, selected from a total of 68.7 billion (12-bit), 4.4 trillion (14-bit) or 281.5 trillion (16-bit) colors that are very accurately described by the LUT.

      "I don't really know much about CHDK, outside of that it lets you program P&S cameras. When it comes to ISO, though, the story is rather tricky. It may be possible to program ISO down to 15 with CHDK, but it may not really do you any good. There are \"real\" ISO settings, and there are \"artificial\" ISO settings. A real ISO setting would be something like ISO 100, which is usually the base ISO for many cameras (some have a base ISO of 200). This is an analog setting, adjusting the ISO to any of the \"real\" native settings will usually work by changing the analog readout of the sensor. \n",
      "In contrast, an artificial ISO setting is either achieved by making other \"behind the scenes\" changes to other settings on the camera, or by \"digitally enhancing\" the nearest real ISO setting. In the case of \"behind the scenes\" ISO, rather than actually changing the ISO when choosing, say, ISO 50, the camera may actually reduce the exposure time at ISO 100 instead. In the case of \"digitally enhancing\" ISO, the camera may use ISO 100 when you choose ISO 50, then apply a digital filter to the resulting image to make it appear as though it was shot at ISO 50. \n",
      "Generally speaking, using artificial ISO settings is undesirable. You generally don't really know what is going on behind the scenes, and if the camera is changing settings to make it appear as though you are really using ISO 50, it may adversely affect your image, preventing you from capturing the scene you really wanted to capture. Most of the time, it is best to use \"real\" ISO settings that change the analog readout from the sensor. If you need to lengthen your exposure times beyond what the native base ISO setting allows (usually ISO 100, sometimes ISO 200), then filtration is usually the best option.  This translates into the formula:  The term 'infinity' here is not used in its classical sense, rather it is more of an optical engineering term meaning a focal point beyond the hyperfocal distance. The full formula for calculating DOF directly, without first calculating hyperfocal distance, as as follows (substitute for H):  \n",

      "Keep in mind lag times. Every camera has lag times for mirror blackout, metering, af, and shutter activation. Your timing between mirror flip to mirror flip needs to account for those lag times, which will mostly occur before the shutter opens.\n",

      "The tint slider takes care of a couple things. First off, from a color perception standpoint, there are two major axes that the cones of our eyes base color perception on: blue/yellow and magenta/green. There are some specific nuances related to these axes, however the most important is that they represent opposite colors that the human eye can not see simultaneously at any given single point (i.e. you can't see blue and yellow at the same location point...the eye oscillates between the two....however you could see blue and or green.) Most color calculations that involve human perception are done in Lab* space, which is fundamentally based on those two axes of color. \n",
      "When it comes to the blue/yellow axis, this happens to be the primary axis along with white point falls. White point is a critical component of color balance, and is generally why we make color temperature adjustments far more frequently than we do tint adjustments. This is partly due to the kinds of illumination we normally use to light photographic scenes as well. Sunlight, incandescent lighting, and a considerable amount of photographic artificial lighting is achieved via black-body emission lighting...matter heated to the point of emitting light. Such lighting usually emits light along the blue/yellow axis, rather than the green/magenta axis. \n",
      "Another form of lighting, gas-emission lighting, usually emits light more in line with the green/magenta axis. Gas-emission lighting is usually found in fluorescent lights, neon lighting, etc. Scenes photographed under gas-emission lighting will usually take on a greenish or slightly magenta-tinged appearance (at the best of times), or may end up with a more aberrant appearance. The Tint slider in Lightroom is a way to correct for \"off-axis\" color balance issues often caused by gas-emission lighting or any form of non-standard (blackbody) lighting. \n",
      "Generally speaking, color balance corrections will be done primarily with the Color Temperature slider, with minor adjustments to the Tint slider. Alternatively, the color temperature and tint sliders can be used to accomplish artistic effect, adding a strong color cast to your photos when one is absent. You may have a scene that is slightly purple-tinged, and one can enhance the artistic appearance of that purple tinge by making a larger-than-normal tint adjustment towards magenta.\n",

Map the same color \"Pure Green\" is AdobeRGB, and while numerically it is the same green, when mapped in AdobeRGB it's more saturated and vibrant. (Further, map the same color in ProPhotoRGB, and it will again be even more saturated than in AdobeRGB...assuming, of course, that the device your viewing this mapped color in is actually capable of achieving that level of color saturation...very few devices actually are.)\n",
      "Now, in comes bit depth. The difference between Pure Green in 8-bit and 16-bit is 0,255,0 vs. 0,65535,0. A much larger number is used to describe the green channel in pure green in 16-bit color than in 8-bit color. If we bring in a Medium Green, the value in 8-bit might be 0,128,0 while in 16-bit it would be 0,32768,0. Same color, but the number of distinct colors on the grade between Pure Green and Medium Green is far higher with 16-bit color. You have a total of 32768 distinct levels of green between those two levels in 16-bit, vs. a mere 128 distinct levels in 8-bit. Lets say we pick a lighter green, say 0,192,0 in 8-bit. That same color would be 0,49152,0 in 16-bit. This increase in potential distinct colors means that gradients become considerably smoother and more finely delineated when using a higher bit depth.\n",
      "Finally, how do bit depths and color spaces work together? With a narrow gamut, like sRGB, you have a restricted color space within which to map distinct colors. With sRGB and 8-bit color, each color is going to be truly distinct as you go through all the greens from from 0,1,0 through 0,128,0 to 0,255,0. What happens if you have a 16-bit image in the sRGB space? Numerically, your image has the ability to represent over 280 trillion distinct colors (16+16+16 bits is 48 bits total, 2^48 is 281.5 trillion). Perceptually...when numeric RGB values are mapped to gamut-restricted colors, a significant amount of that 280 trillion colors will end up getting mapped to the exact same \"color coordinate\" within the color space. Your image file still contains full precision color data, however when it is rendered to the screen (or rendered to print), the actual number of distinct colors is ultimately going to be limited by the color space.\n",
      "If we move up to AdobeRGB, the gamut grows, it's a larger color space and can therefor encompass a greater number of distinct color mappings. With an 8-bit color depth, your effectively going to be sparsely mapping into this larger gamut. Technically speaking, the gamut is capable of describing more colors than your bit depth is allowing you to reference. Your limiting factors have now swapped...instead of the gamut being restrictive, bit depth is being restrictive. If we go with 16-bit color in the AdobeRGB color space, there is more room for our 280 trillion potential colors to reference distinct colors. It's likely that multiple colors will still map to the same actual coordinates in AdobeRGB space, however there will be far fewer collisions in this larger space than with sRGB.\n",
      "So, while color space/gamut and bit depth are distinct things, they are interrelated. You are not required to use a larger gamut when using a higher bit depth to store your image data, however it is advisable to get the most out of that higher bit depth. Conversely, if you are saving images with a lower bit depth, there is often less value in rendering those images with anything more than sRGB. \n",
      "To fully take advantage of high bit depth color information in an image file, larger gamuts, and concurrently better screens that can actually display those gamuts, become valuable. To render 10, 12, and 16 bit color on TVs or computer screens, gamuts larger than AdobeRGB, and even larger than ProPhotoRGB, are often necessary to take full advantage of human visual perception. Our eyes are amazing devices, and capable of incredible dynamic range and extremely wide color sensitivity. Modern day 10-bit screens with 12-, 14-, and 16-bit hardware LUTs (3D Color Look Up Tables) are capable of displaying 1.07 billion concurrent colors, selected from a total of 68.7 billion (12-bit), 4.4 trillion (14-bit) or 281.5 trillion (16-bit) colors that are very accurately described by the LUT.

      "I don't really know much about CHDK, outside of that it lets you program P&S cameras. When it comes to ISO, though, the story is rather tricky. It may be possible to program ISO down to 15 with CHDK, but it may not really do you any good. There are \"real\" ISO setting s, and there are \"artificial\" ISO settings. A real ISO setting would be something like ISO 100, which is usually the base ISO for many cameras (some have a base ISO of 200). This is an analog setting, adjusting the ISO to any of the \"real\" native settings will usually work by changing the analog readout of the sensor. \n",
      "In contrast, an artificial ISO setting is either achieved by making other \"behind the scenes\" changes to other settings on the camera, or by \"digitally enhancing\" the nearest real ISO setting. In the case of \"behind the scenes\" ISO, rather than actually changing the ISO when choosing, say, ISO 50, the camera may actually reduce the exposure time at ISO 100 instead. In the case of \"digitally enhancing\" ISO, the camera may use ISO 100 when you choose ISO 50, then apply a digital filter to the resulting image to make it appear as though it was shot at ISO 50. \n",
      "Generally speaking, using artificial ISO settings is undesirable. You generally don't really know what is going on behind the scenes, and if the camera is changing settings to make it appear as though you are really using ISO 50, it may adversely affect your image, preventing you from capturing the scene you really wanted to capture. Most of the time, it is best to use \"real\" ISO settings that change the analog readout from the sensor. If you need to lengthen your exposure times beyond what the native base ISO setting allows (usually ISO 100, sometimes ISO 200), then filtration is usually the best option.  This translates into the formula:  The term 'infinity' here is not used in its classical sense, rather it is more of an optical engineering term meaning a focal point beyond the hyperfocal distance. The full formula for calculating DOF directly, without first calculating hyperfocal distance, as as follows (substitute for H):  \n",

      "The tint slider takes care of a couple things. First off, from a color perception standpoint, there are two major axes that the cones of our eyes base color perception on: blue/yellow and magenta/green. There are some specific nuances related to these axes, however the most important is that they represent opposite colors that the human eye can not see simultaneously at any given single point (i.e. you can't see blue and yellow at the same location point...the eye oscillates between the two....however you could see blue and or green.) Most color calculations that involve human perception are done in Lab* space, which is fundamentally based on those two axes of color. \n",
      "When it comes to the blue/yellow axis, this happens to be the primary axis along with white point falls. White point is a critical component of color balance, and is generally why we make color temperature adjustments far more frequently than we do tint adjustments. This is partly due to the kinds of illumination we normally use to light photographic scenes as well. Sunlight, incandescent lighting, and a considerable amount of photographic artificial lighting is achieved via black-body emission lighting...matter heated to the point of emitting light. Such lighting usually emits light along the blue/yellow axis, rather than the green/magenta axis. \n",
      "Another form of lighting, gas-emission lighting, usually emits light more in line with the green/magenta axis. Gas-emission lighting is usually found in fluorescent lights, neon lighting, etc. Scenes photographed under gas-emission lighting will usually take on a greenish or slightly magenta-tinged appearance (at the best of times), or may end up with a more aberrant appearance. The Tint slider in Lightroom is a way to correct for \"off-axis\" color balance issues often caused by gas-emission lighting or any form of non-standard (blackbody) lighting. \n",
      "Generally speaking, color balance corrections will be done primarily with the Color Temperature slider, with minor adjustments to the Tint slider. Alternatively, the color temperature and tint sliders can be used to accomplish artistic effect, adding a strong color cast to your photos when one is absent. You may have a scene that is slightly purple-tinged, and one can enhance the artistic appearance of that purple tinge by making a larger-than-normal tint adjustment towards magenta.\n",

      "This is more of a hardware question than anything, but it has to do with Android.\n",
      "I saw on this question, somebody saying that Android apps were architecture independent, and should run on ARM/ARM64/x86 platforms.  Another reply was saying that the APK files can have architecture-dependent libraries, but not code themselves.\n",
      "Now, here's where my question comes in.\n",
      "I was looking inside the contents of an APK file, and I noticed that the only \"lib\" folder was for armeabi (32-bit ARM).  But, my phone has a 64-bit ARM processor (aarch64, with the arm64-v8a instruction set), and the app runs fine.  Hmm... how does that work?\n",
      "So I thought I would try a few other things.\n",
      "I installed Android-x86 in a virtual machine, logged into a Google account, and downloaded a few games.  The one in question, which only has the \"armeabi\" folder, showed up as being compatible (as in, the install button was there) - but it immediately crashed after opening.  I know there are some games that fake-crash on rooted devices (and Android-x86 comes pre-rooted), but the one in question is not one of them.  I've used it on CyanogenMod on a real phone and it doesn't care.\n",
      "But something else I noticed: at least one other game I was looking for did not show up - the game Super Mario Run from Nintendo.  See my screenshot here: Notice under \"Library\" there's no option to install it, and if you look at apps published by Nintendo, it's just not in that list (which means the Play Store is deciding my hardware is incompatible, and basically hiding it).  But, it DID seem to think my Android-x86 VM was compatible with the OTHER games, which just crash immediately.\n",
      "So I decided to try something else.  I picked up a cheap Intel Atom-based processor (one of the Insignia brand ones at Best Buy, as it's all you can get these days that's carried in stores).  Run CPU-Z on there, you can confirm it's x86 and not ARM.  Super Mario Run shows up, however, and works fine - so do the other games with only \"armeabi\" libraries!\n",

      "So in this case, is the tablet only able to run these games because its GPU is ARM? If so, what's the actual significance of the CPU portion being x86? I'm completely confused at that.\n",
      "I was considering tracking down a used older tablet with an Intel Atom, that still used the \"Intel HD Graphics\", and was not a hybrid ARM chipset.  Something like a Toshiba Excite Go.  But this is really just to find out if it would act the same as Android-x86, or if those apps would work.  I'm curious what the incompatibilities/crashes are - is it just because Android-x86 is a hackjob and not official? Or do the apps with only \"armeabi\" libraries truly only work on ARM processors and somehow the Insignia can run them because of its hybrid chip?\n",

I don't know much about ARM but I know in the case of AMD64, it's an extension on top of the traditional x86 architecture so you can natively run both x86 and x64 programs - also why they won over Itanium, which was not like this.)\n",
      "Lastly, as far as the Play store recognizing whether an app is compatible or not - I would assume the developer doesn't have an actual whitelist of all devices the app can run on, that would be incredibly stupid and any time a new Android device came out, it would cause issues.  So how exactly does that work? Do they provide minimum required RAM/CPU/resolution, things like that? Based on architecture as well?  I know I've seen some apps that show as being incompatible with a larger-resolution tablet (like the Samsung View) that do work on phones, and always thought that was strange.\n",
      "Edit: One of the suggested threads from this one was actually about how the Play Store knows an app is incompatible, based on the app's manifest.  And as much as it might make sense that it would be incompatible if it requires GPS and your device doesn't have GPS, or Bluetooth, etc., that doesn't really explain why an app would install fine on a 7\" tablet but not a Samsung View.

      "It makes little difference whether money is spent or invested. One man's spending causes another man's investment to be profitable.\n",
      "If the wealthy never spend their money, they control a smaller fraction of the increasing productivity. If they do, they cause other people to make money. \n",
      "Just like in any other business, what you would need is some advantage over everyone else. That might be in the form of a very low cost of capital that would allow you to acquire mining hardware at a lower effective cost than others. That might be an exceptionally low cost of electricity. That might be something you can do with the heat bitcoin miners generate rather than having to pay to remove it.\n",
      "But absent that, you can't make a profit bitcoin mining. That's because the difficulty of bitcoin mining (how much work you have to do to mine a block) adjusts automatically to keep the block rate constant. So if mining was generally profitable without requiring anything special, more people would mine and the difficulty would go up.\n",
      "That is precisely what has happened. The difficulty has gone up to the point where unless you have some special advantage over others, you cannot make money by mining.\n",
      "You will be competing against businesses that have covered every base -- the lowest cost for the ASICS, the lowest cost for electricity, the lowest cost for physical space, and so on. If you have no plan to match that, don't mine. The gateway gets to set its own policies. However, the general consensus is that gateways should avoid risk because they'd have to pass losses onto their customers in the form of higher fees. So you probably shouldn't trust a gateway that extends IOUs to people whose money it doesn't hold.\n",
      "If the gateway breaches its contract with you, you should complain publicly, sue them, or take whatever action you consider appropriate. Gateways are only worth their reputations. \n",
      "The transaction would have no effect. A transaction that wasn't accepted by the network has no effect on the ability to spend coins. The person whose coins were affected could simply delete that transaction from his own database. There's no need to undo the transaction since it was never committed to the block chain anyway. \n",
      "The way Ripple's public ledger system works is that you propose a payment by specifying the source and destination accounts and currencies and then the system gives you a quote based on public offers. You can then specify a maximum amount you are willing to pay to complete the payment and submit it. If the payment is possible for the amount you offered or less, the payment succeeds. Otherwise it fails and you can try again.\n",
      "Ripple uses pathfinding to figure out how the payment is possible, if it is. Essentially, it looks for a chain of market makers or currency traders willing to put together a trade where one of them gets the asset you're paying with and one of them provides the asset you're paying with.\n",
      "In the short term, to ensure payments work, banks typically do the very same thing they're doing now. They put exchange offers into the system the same way they would if they didn't have Ripple.\n",

      "The answer is, as Nate explained, that the miner is a sunk cost. Obviously, no sane person would buy a miner if they knew they would be in the situation you described.\n",
      "The future value of Bitcoins is almost irrelevant to the profitability of mining. You can get the same exposure to the profitability of Bitcoins by buying and holding. (The contrary assumption leads to comically absurd results.)\n",
      "Sane people buy Bitcoin mining hardware because they expect to do better than they would if they used that same money to buy Bitcoins. Changes in difficulty or the cost of electricity may result in them not making money, but no human endeavor is certain to succeed. \n",
      "As soon as it costs more to provide electricity to the miner than the value of the coins mined, the miner get shut off and retired. \n",
      "As you mine, you earn shares. The more hashes you do, the more shares you earn. PPLNS means that every time the pool mines a block, shares of the reward are distributed to the miners that mined the most recent shares. Often, N is chosen as twice the difficulty. So if, on average, a block will be found every one billion shares, the block reward is divided to those who submitted the last two billion shares when the block was found. \n",

      "If the wealthy never spend their money, they control a smaller fraction of the increasing productivity. If they do, they cause other people to make money. \n",
      "Just like in any other business, what you would need is some advantage over everyone else. That might be in the form of a very low cost of capital that would allow you to acquire mining hardware at a lower effective cost than others. That might be an exceptionally low cost of electricity. That might be something you can do with the heat bitcoin miners generate rather than having to pay to remove it.\n",
      "But absent that, you can't make a profit bitcoin mining. That's because the difficulty of bitcoin mining (how much work you have to do to mine a block) adjusts automatically to keep the block rate constant. So if mining was generally profitable without requiring anything special, more people would mine and the difficulty would go up.\n",
      "That is precisely what has happened. The difficulty has gone up to the point where unless you have some special advantage over others, you cannot make money by mining.\n",
      "You will be competing against businesses that have covered every base -- the lowest cost for the ASICS, the lowest cost for electricity, the lowest cost for physical space, and so on. If you have no plan to match that, don't mine. The gateway gets to set its own policies. However, the general consensus is that gateways should avoid risk because they'd have to pass losses onto their customers in the form of higher fees. So you probably shouldn't trust a gateway that extends IOUs to people whose money it doesn't hold.\n",

      "The way Ripple's public ledger system works is that you propose a payment by specifying the source and destination accounts and currencies and then the system gives you a quote based on public offers. You can then specify a maximum amount you are willing to pay to complete the payment and submit it. If the payment is possible for the amount you offered or less, the payment succeeds. Otherwise it fails and you can try again.\n",
      "Ripple uses pathfinding to figure out how the payment is possible, if it is. Essentially, it looks for a chain of market makers or currency traders willing to put together a trade where one of them gets the asset you're paying with and one of them provides the asset you're paying with.\n",
      "In the short term, to e nsure payments work, banks typically do the very same thing they're doing now. They put exchange offers into the system the same way they would if they didn't have Ripple.\n",

      "The answer is, as Nate explained, that the miner is a sunk cost. Obviously, no sane person would buy a miner if they knew they would be in the situation you described.\n",
      "The future value of Bitcoins is almost irrelevant to the profitability of mining. You can get the same exposure to the profitability of Bitcoins by buying and holding. (The contrary assumption leads to comically absurd results.)\n",

      "As you mine, you earn shares. The more hashes you do, the more shares you earn. PPLNS means that every time the pool mines a block, shares of the reward are distributed to the miners that mined the most recent shares. Often, N is chosen as twice the difficulty.

The book is bilingual, with all articles appearing in both English and Spanish: English text on left-hand pages, Spanish on right-hand pages. The Spanish text is usually about 25–30% longer than the English text.\n",

In this endeavour, nothing was spared: font size, kerning, and leading were all rather randomly and egregiously tweaked up and down on a per-paragraph (sometimes even per-line) basis. The result was a mess, so I decided to start over, keeping font-size, kerning, and leading consistent throughout and simply finding a good balance in size difference where the English and Spanish texts end up being of approximately equal length.\n",

My concern now is that this differentiation is not strong enough to create a proper visual cue: it doesn’t break apart the left-hand pages from the right-hand pages as efficiently as colour does, and I fear the reader will just continue from the English text right into the Spanish text automatically and have to do a little double-take and back up to get back into the sentence they were reading—hardly optimal for good book design!\n",
      "I have considered a few alternative options on how to make the visual cue clearer, but they have rather obvious downsides: (You can also click on the “+” icon on the right and choose “Partial Paragraph” from the dropdown menu, and then add in the period manually.)\n",
      "This cuts off everything in the source content after the first instance of the character “.”. Since the gallery list has a period after the number, this  boils down to cutting off everything after the number, so the target content ends up being just the number, “8”.\n",

      "I’m currently laying out and typesetting the second edition of an academic book about European fisheries and their status in the current EU climate. The book is bilingual, with all articles appearing in both English and Spanish: English text on left-hand pages, Spanish on right-hand pages. The Spanish text is usually about 25–30% longer than the English text.\n",
      "The first edition of the book was typeset and laid out by a Spanish designer, and I don’t think it’s saying too much that it looked horrible. Not only was there no baseline grid, the text (both in English and in Spanish, but most noticeably in the English) was also maltreated rather cruelly to make the length of the two versions match up. In this endeavour, nothing was spared: font size, kerning, and leading were all rather randomly and egregiously tweaked up and down on a per-paragraph (sometimes even per-line) basis. The result was a mess, so I decided to start over, keeping font-size, kerning, and leading consistent throughout and simply finding a good balance in size difference where the English and Spanish texts end up being of approximately equal length.\n",
      "In the first edition, the Spanish text was set in a different (and rather unpleasing, it must be said) colour to the English text, which had the desired effect of breaking the two up quite clearly. Obviously, since we’re used to reading from the left page to the right, a fairly strong visual cue is needed to let the reader know he shouldn’t be doing that here. Unfortunately, the funding for the second edition is not quite sufficient that full-colour printing is feasible, so I’m having to go a different path.\n",
      "The strategy I have so far gone with is to choose a font that has both serif and sans-serif variants, and using that as a visual cue: left page/English in serif, right page/Spanish in sans serif (I’ve gone with Fedra, just because I quite like it and it’s a good, readable font that isn’t overused). The result looks something like this (lo-res, but you get the idea):1\n",

Its important to note that you will need to create a calibration shot for each and every lighting setup you have, because they are only valid for one specific lighting case at a time. If you are using warm lighting for one set of shots, and cool lighting for another set of shots, both sets should have their own calibration shot with a gray card and color checker card. \n",
      "You would then import the calibration shot, use the eyedropper to set WB, and possibly figure out what other fine-tuning curves adjustments are necessary to produce accurate reproductions of all of the colors in the color checker card.

That should get you the most accurate color possible if thats what you need.\n",

      "Atmospheric phenomena can enhance light pollution. Even if you are not right next to a city, you can still suffer from their light pollution if you point in the right direction. I believe your first image is definitely suffering from some LP, probably exacerbated by an inversion layer or other haze phenomena.\n",
      "I often image at a dark site that is 35 minutes out of town, deep in a rural area with very dark skies at 21.3mag/sq\". However, to the west is the greater Denver metropolitan area and all the surrounding cities. The LP bubble from this highly populated area stretches nearly 40 degrees into the sky, and affects up to 60 degrees, above the western horizon. As such, I only image to the east, north, and sightly south. To the south there are additional LP bubbles, albeit lower towards the horizon (most not topping 30 degrees). \n",
      "As for your other two images. Astrophotography is an extremely low-signal form of photography. The vast majority of the pixels in any given frame will be barely above the read noise floor, and would be considered \"black\" pixels in most normal photos. Only stars will reach much above the noise floor, and even then, not many will be much more than 50% of the signal range of the sensor. \n",
      "For this reason, in order to get decent astro photos, it is necessary to track unless one is going solely for ultra wide field milky way images. Even then, some level of tracking is usually necessary to get quality results. For most astro photos, total integrated exposure time in the realm of a couple hours to many tens of hours is usually necessary, depending on how much noise the camera has, how dark your skies are, how transparent the sky is, and exactly how faint the details are. \n",
      "You can take a look at my astrophotography on AstroBin for some examples of how much total integration time it takes to get various kinds of objects:\n",

      "Most of my work is with a Canon 5D III with a large f/4 scope from a dark site. However I also have some images with a new mono CMOS camera purchased this year, using narrow band filters, as well as some older work from my light polluted back yard with DSLRs. You can get an idea of how much total exposure time is required...and it is often in the 8-10 hour range for DSLR RGB, 2-4 hours for bright nebula w/ narrow band filters, and 15-30 hours for faint nebula with narrow band filters.  \n",
      "It sounds like you might have just had an aperture setting that was too wide, or you have too much camera shake. Either one will cause some degree of softness. \n",
      "Aperture and Focus\n",
      "The size of the aperture (the hole in the \"middle\" of the lens created by the diaphragm) controls more than just the amount of light that can pass through the lens...it also controls the depth of field. The depth of field, or DOF, determines how much depth within your scene, from the point of exact focus, both towards the camera and away from the camera, that is \"in focus\". A wider aperture (smaller f/#, such as f/2.8 or f/3.5) produces a smaller (or thinner) DOF. A narrower aperture (larger f/#, such as f/8 or f/22) produces a larger DOF. Generally speaking, if you want more of your scene to be \"in focus\", you need to use a narrower aperture.\n",
      "Now, beyond the simple basics of DOF and aperture, there are more concerns to be taken into account. Depth of field is a function of aperture, focal length, and subject distance. The closer the subject you are focusing on, the thinner your DOF, while the farther the subject, the deeper your DOF, for a given aperture. A longer focal length will also increase the depth of field for any given aperture, however they also tend to magnify the effect of defocus blurring (along with magnifying everything else), so from a focus standpoint, longer focal lengths won't help much.\n",
      "Camera Shake and Softness\n",
      "Another problem that can cause image softness, particularly at longer focal lengths, is camera shake. If you are taking photographs hand-held with a long focal length, without the benefit of IS/VR (image stabilization/vibration reduction) technology, then camera shake can be a real problem. Even on a tripod or monopod, small movements or shakes can still be a problem that softens images. The longer the focal length, the more magnified the scene you are photographing. That magnification affects everything, including the effects of camera movement.\n",
      "If you are shooting with a longer focal length lens (i.e. 85-100mm and up) under low enough light that your shutter speed is at or lower than the focal length of the lens, even small movements translate into image softening or even outright blurring. A 300mm or longer lens, hand-held, is pretty much unusable without either hands as steady as God's, or the benefit of some kind of image stabilization technology. You can do a few things to solve the problem of camera shake at longer focal lengths. Obviously, one would be to get a lens with image stabilization. Usually, IS is rated in \"stops of hand-holdability\", and can range from one stops worth to as many as four stops worth. Each stop worth of additional hand-holdability affects how low of a shutter speed you can use below the \"reciprocal rule\" speed. (The reciprocal rule simply states that a shutter speed of 1/focalLength is as low as you can go without the effects of camera shake affecting sharpness.) If you have a 100mm lens and no IS, you would be limited to shooting at 1/100s shutter speed or higher to get sharp hand-held pictures. A 100mm lens with 4-stop IS, on the other hand, would allow you to get sharp hand-held pictures at about 1/12s shutter speed.\n",
      "Beyond buying a new lens, there are a couple other things you can do. For one, get a tripod and a cable release, and set up and frame your shots on the tripod, and trigger the shutter with the cable release (or wireless trigger.) That will ensure hands-off operation, keeping the camera as stable as possible. Additionally, you can increase another factor of exposure. If you have the option, a wider aperture will allow more light down the lens, supporting a faster shutter speed. If opening the aperture is not an option, you can also increase the ISO setting of the camera. If you are shooting at ISO 100 with that 100mm lens, but your shutter speed needs to be 1/50s, using ISO 200 should let you get that 1/100s shutter speed. Using ISO 400 will let you use a 1/200s shutter speed, giving you some wiggle room to tweak aperture or cover a small amount of camera shake without affecting sharpness.\n",
      "Soft Lens\n",
      "There is one additional possibility that may not be something you can fix without replacing the lens: a soft lens. Before assuming your lens is soft, try other options to see if you can correct sharpness...such as using a tripod or shooting with a tighter aperture. A small percentage of the time, some lenses come improperly calibrated, and that can cause a consistent softness that cannot be corrected by any photographer action. A poorly calibrated lens can probably be fixed by sending it into the manufacturer or taking it to a local camera shop. There are also lenses that are simply not as sharp as others, usually at wider apertures, where uncorrected optical aberrations infringe upon an otherwise sharp picture. Sometimes this is simply a facet lens design...it may be intentional (i.e. purposely uncorrected spherical aberration in a fast portrait lens), or it may be due to the cheaper components of a cheap lens.\n",

The LP bubble from this highly populated area stretches nearly 40 degrees into the sky, and affects up to 60 degrees, above the western horizon. As such, I only image to the east, north, and sightly south. To the south there are additional LP bubbles, albeit lower towards the horizon (most not topping 30 degrees). \n",
      "As for your other two images. Astrophotography is an extremely low-signal form of photography. The vast majority of the pixels in any given frame will be barely above the read noise floor, and would be considered \"black\" pixels in most normal photos. Only stars will reach much above the noise floor, and even then, not many will be much more than 50% of the signal range of the sensor. \n",
      "For this reason, in order to get decent astro photos, it is necessary to track unless one is going solely for ultra wide field milky way images. Even then, some level of tracking is usually necessary to get quality results. For most astro photos, total integrated exposure time in the realm of a couple hours to many tens of hours is usually necessary, depending on how much noise the camera has, how dark your skies are, how transparent the sky is, and exactly how faint the details are. \n",
      "You can take a look at my astrophotography on AstroBin for some examples of how much total integration time it takes to get various kinds of objects:\n",

      "Most of my work is with a Canon 5D III with a large f/4 scope from a dark site. However I also have some images with a new mono CMOS camera purchased this year, using narrow band filters, as well as some older work from my light polluted back yard with DSLRs. You can get an idea of how much total exposure time is required...and it is often in the 8-10 hour range for DSLR RGB, 2-4 hours for bright nebula w/ narrow band filters, and 15-30 hours for faint nebula with narrow band filters.  \n",
      "It sounds like you might have just had an aperture setting that was too wide, or you have too much camera shake. Either one will cause some deg ree of softness. \n",
      "Aperture and Focus\n",
      "The size of the aperture (the hole in the \"middle\" of the lens created by the diaphragm) controls more than just the amount of light that can pass through the lens...it also controls the depth of field. The depth of field, or DOF, determines how much depth within your scene, from the point of exact focus, both towards the camera and away from the camera, that is \"in focus\". A wider aperture (smaller f/#, such as f/2.8 or f/3.5) produces a smaller (or thinner) DOF. A narrower aperture (larger f/#, such as f/8 or f/22) produces a larger DOF. Generally speaking, if you want more of your scene to be \"in focus\", you need to use a narrower aperture.\n",
      "Now, beyond the simple basics of DOF and aperture, there are more concerns to be taken into account. Depth of field is a function of aperture, focal length, and subject distance. The closer the subject you are focusing on, the thinner your DOF, while the farther the subject, the deeper your DOF, for a given aperture. A longer focal length will also increase the depth of field for any given aperture, however they also tend to magnify the effect of defocus blurring (along with magnifying everything else), so from a focus standpoint, longer focal lengths won't help much.\n",
      "Camera Shake and Softness\n",
      "Another problem that can cause image softness, particularly at longer focal lengths, is camera shake. If you are taking photographs hand-held with a long focal length, without the benefit of IS/VR (image stabilization/vibration reduction) technology, then camera shake can be a real problem. Even on a tripod or monopod, small movements or shakes can still be a problem that softens images. The longer the focal length, the more magnified the scene you are photographing. That magnification affects everything, including the effects of camera movement.\n",
      "If you are shooting with a longer focal length lens (i.e. 85-100mm and up) under low enough light that your shutter speed is at or lower than the focal length of the lens, even small movements translate into image softening or even outright blurring. A 300mm or longer lens, hand-held, is pretty much unusable without either hands as steady as God's, or the benefit of some kind of image stabilization technology. You can do a few things to solve the problem of camera shake at longer focal lengths. Obviously, one would be to get a lens with image stabilization. Usually, IS is rated in \"stops of hand-holdability\", and can range from one stops worth to as many as four stops worth. Each stop worth of additional hand-holdability affects how low of a shutter speed you can use below the \"reciprocal rule\" speed. (The reciprocal rule simply states that a shutter speed of 1/focalLength is as low as you can go without the effects of camera shake affecting sharpness.) If you have a 100mm lens and no IS, you would be limited to shooting at 1/100s shutter speed or higher to get sharp hand-held pictures. A 100mm lens with 4-stop IS, on the other hand, would allow you to get sharp hand-held pictures at about 1/12s shutter speed.\n",
      "Beyond buying a new lens, there are a couple other things you can do. For one, get a tripod and a cable release, and set up and frame your shots on the tripod, and trigger the shutter with the cable release (or wireless trigger.) That will ensure hands-off operation, keeping the camera as stable as possible. Additionally, you can increase another factor of exposure. If you have the option, a wider aperture will allow more light down the lens, supporting a faster shutter speed. If opening the aperture is not an option, you can also increase the ISO setting of the camera. If you are shooting at ISO 100 with that 100mm lens, but your shutter speed needs to be 1/50s, using ISO 200 should let you get that 1/100s shutter speed. Using ISO 400 will let you use a 1/200s shutter speed, giving you some wiggle room to tweak aperture or cover a small amount of camera shake without affecting sharpness.\n",
      "Soft Lens\n",
      "There is one additional possibility that may not be something you can fix without replacing the lens: a soft lens. Before assuming your lens is soft, try other options to see if you can correct sharpness...such as using a tripod or shooting with a tighter aperture. A small percentage of the time, some lenses come improperly calibrated, and that can cause a consistent softness that cannot be corrected by any photographer action. A poorly calibrated lens can probably be fixed by sending it into the manufacturer or taking it to a local camera shop. There are also lenses that are simply not as sharp as others, usually at wider apertures, where uncorrected optical aberrations infringe upon an otherwise sharp picture. Sometimes this is simply a facet lens design...it may be intentional (i.e. purposely uncorrected spherical aberration in a fast portrait lens), or it may be due to the cheaper components of a cheap lens.\n",

      "Let me first answer your actual question (and then I'll proceed to answer something slightly different that I think will be informative and helpful). Your question asks whether it's possible to use only a DSA key. Technically speaking, this is of course possible. The reason is that a DSA key has exactly the same format as an ElGamal key. No one forces you to use the key with the proper algorithm. (I know that this is a bit stupid, but it will be more meaningful after what follows below.) Just note that if you use the key both for DSA signing and for ElGamal encryption then you may have security problems, and you need to formally prove that this combination is OK. (By the way, this is all OK since Alice already has Bob's public key, so there is no problem of authenticating the key, etc.)\n",
      "Despite the above answer, I have a feeling that what you are really asking is whether or not it's possible to use signatures alone in order to securely encrypt (in the public key setting, without a shared symmetric key). I'll translate it to \"is it possible to use signatures alone to get key exchange\" since key exchange is more relaxed than public-key encryption. \n",
      "This is an excellent question. The first problem with the question is \"how to formalize using one primitive to get another\". The naive way of doing this is saying that if A exists then B exists. So, your question would be: is the following statement true \"if signatures exist then key exchange exists\". However, we believe that both signatures exist and key exchange exists, which if true, makes the statement logically true irrespective of any connection between signatures and key exchange. This led Impagliazzo and Rudich in their groundbreaking work Limits on the Provable Consequences of One way Permutations to define that one primitive implies another if one can be constructed from the other using a black-box reduction (and in a world where no other crypto exists, which can be achieved by giving the adversary an NP-oracle to solve all NP problems, for example). Note that most (but not all) reductions in crypto are black box. It is beyond the scope here to define black box, but for here it suffices to say that the primitive is used based on its input/output functionality only, and the reduction uses the adversary in a black-box way as well.\n",
      "Now, back to your question. The answer is no. Impagliazzo and Rudich proved that one-way functions do not imply key exchange in this setting. Stated differently, it is impossible to construct a black box reduction from one-way functions to key exchange. Noting now that signatures can be constructed from one-way functions only (One-Way Functions are Necessary and Sufficient for Secure Signatures, Rompel), this implies that there exists no black-box reduction from signatures to key exchange. I remark that this result by Impagliazzo and Rudich holds in the presence of an eavesdropping adversary only, so it has nothing to do with man-in-the-middle attacks or anything like that.\n",
      "Let's conclude by going back to DSA. Note that it is possible to use a DSA key to get key exchange; as I said, just use it for El Gamal. However, this is exactly the difference. My use of DSA is not black box. Rather, I am utilizing the number-theoretic properties and the structure of the DSA key. Thus, this does not contradict the result of Impagliazzo and Rudich. \n",
      "You should use AES. If you have the AES-NI instruction (which most modern chips have), then this performs very fast. For most applications today, AES-128 is certainly sufficient. However, I want to stress that it's not just the algorithm, it's also the mode of operation. You should use GCM. If you use OpenSSL then with AES-128-GCM you'll get speeds of about 0.7 cycles per byte for encryption (with AES-NI).\n",

In particular, for any $Y$ and any $x_1'$ it can find $x_2'$ such that $Y=g_1^{x_1'}\\cdot g_2^{x_2'}$. Thus, it can open the commitment to any $x_1'$ it likes. As such, it can also prove knowledge of any $x'_1,x'_2$ it wishes. This does not break soundness, since it indeed knows such an $x'_1,x'_2$ and so everything is true.\n",
      "If $z$ is known to the verifier, then this actually makes no difference, because Pedersen is a perfectly hiding commitment. \n",
      "In general, you should study more about Pedersen commitments, and then understand the $\\Sigma$ protocol issue. \n",
      "Let me first answer your actual question (and then I'll proceed to answer something slightly different that I think will be informative and helpful). Your question asks whether it's possible to use only a DSA key. Technically speaking, this is of course possible. The reason is that a DSA key has exactly the same format as an ElGamal key. No one forces you to use the key with the proper algorithm. (I know that this is a bit stupid, but it will be more meaningful after what follows below.) Just note that if you use the key both for DSA signing and for ElGamal encryption then you may have security problems, and you need to formally prove that  this combination is OK. (By the way, this is all OK since Alice already has Bob's public key, so there is no problem of authenticating the key, etc.)\n",
      "Despite the above answer, I have a feeling that what you are really asking is whether or not it's possible to use signatures alone in order to securely encrypt (in the public key setting, without a shared symmetric key). I'll translate it to \"is it possible to use signatures alone to get key exchange\" since key exchange is more relaxed than public-key encryption. \n",
      "This is an excellent question. The first problem with the question is \"how to formalize using one primitive to get another\". The naive way of doing this is saying that if A exists then B exists. So, your question would be: is the following statement true \"if signatures exist then key exchange exists\". However, we believe that both signatures exist and key exchange exists, which if true, makes the statement logically true irrespective of any connection between signatures and key exchange. This led Impagliazzo and Rudich in their groundbreaking work Limits on the Provable Consequences of One way Permutations to define that one primitive implies another if one can be constructed from the other using a black-box reduction (and in a world where no other crypto exists, which can be achieved by giving the adversary an NP-oracle to solve all NP problems, for example). Note that most (but not all) reductions in crypto are black box. It is beyond the scope here to define black box, but for here it suffices to say that the primitive is used based on its input/output functionality only, and the reduction uses the adversary in a black-box way as well.\n",
      "Now, back to your question. The answer is no. Impagliazzo and Rudich proved that one-way functions do not imply key exchange in this setting. Stated differently, it is impossible to construct a black box reduction from one-way functions to key exchange. Noting now that signatures can be constructed from one-way functions only (One-Way Functions are Necessary and Sufficient for Secure Signatures, Rompel), this implies that there exists no black-box reduction from signatures to key exchange. I remark that this result by Impagliazzo and Rudich holds in the presence of an eavesdropping adversary only, so it has nothing to do with man-in-the-middle attacks or anything like that.\n",
      "Let's conclude by going back to DSA. Note that it is possible to use a DSA key to get key exchange; as I said, just use it for El Gamal. However, this is exactly the difference. My use of DSA is not black box. Rather, I am utilizing the number-theoretic properties and the structure of the DSA key. Thus, this does not contradict the result of Impagliazzo and Rudich. \n",
      "You should use AES. If you have the AES-NI instruction (which most modern chips have), then this performs very fast. For most applications today, AES-128 is certainly sufficient. However, I want to stress that it's not just the algorithm, it's also the mode of operation. You should use GCM. If you use OpenSSL then with AES-128-GCM you'll get speeds of about 0.7 cycles per byte for encryption (with AES-NI).\n",

Symptoms are thought to be caused by the immune response in the host, rather than by actual damage caused by the virus [(Hendley (1998)].\n",

Of course, one can find out the cause of the infection diagnostically by taking samples and isolating DNA or setting up cultures, but that is not my question. My question is whether it is possible to predict the virus taxon causing the infection by symptoms.\n",

However, I found a rather dated article by Tyrrell et al. (1993) that analyses infections caused by several rhinovirus strains, a coronavirus, and of the respiratory syncytial virus (virus taxa among the most common infectious agents for common colds).

      "As the answers given already point out, humans are generally considered omnivores that are able to use food sources available to them opportunistically. Apart from that, there actually is not much to debunk in the PETA statement - it is just a slightly one sided view on the history of human diet. Just as one sided as the claims that humans would not have evolved a really big brain without consuming animal products. Especially the canine teeth cannot be seen as evidence for prehistoric hunting, as in great apes the size of canine teeth is ridiculously well explained not only by defensive but mostly by mating behaviour; apart from that, humans do not even have those, and that most likely is caused by the trend towards monogamy which reduces inter-male aggression. \n",
      "However, coming back to the actual question, in the relative short history (approx. 200-300ky) of our species there is evidence for 'several transitions towards or away from a vegetarian diet in humans' (Nielsen et al., 2017).\n",
      "And in fact, there even is a human-specific evolutionary derived haplotype (younger than the Human-Neandertal split) that shows signatures of positive selection and is associated with increased efficiency in the synthesis of long chain fatty acid from plant precursor molecules - which would not really be necessary, as these fatty acids are readily available in animal products (Ameur et al., 2012). More specifically, the genes lying on that haplotype belong to the FADS cluster that seemed to have had adaptive value - also for synthesising long chain fatty acids from medium chain plant precursor fatty acids - in African populations even more recently (approx. 85 kya, Mathias et al. 2012).\n",
      "This finding has been supported by a more recent study by Kothapalli et al. (2016). They investigated a 22bp-indel allele in the FADS2 gene that is associated with both higher blood levels of long chain fatty acids and exhibits high frequency (signature of positive selection) especially in South Asia and Africa where there is long tradition for plant-based diet. I would say that there is no feasible way of studying this question. You will find different selective constraints on every single enzyme and breaking this down to DNA this means that every single locus can be target of different selective pressures. And even if you figured out how to answer that question comprehensively for a given species (which probably will not happen), generalising it to every single species in every ecological niche, with every possible population history and so on is close to impossible. That is why one studies sequence diversity/conservation in model organisms and mostly on a per-gene basis.\n",
      "In general, without knowing any background of a species and enzyme, I would however expect two things when looking at molecular variation between individuals of that species. These are merely based on general evolutionary principles and the nature of the genetic code. Keep in mind that these are trends, meaning that many genes will match these expectations but some definitely will not due to lineage-specific evolution.\n",
      "First, I would expect generally high levels of amino acid conservation (but not always identity) especially in functional enzymes of core pathways. However, this depends on the function of the gene product. If the gene is a target of balancing selection, which maintains genetic variation within a population, there can also be considerable amino acid variation.\n",
      "Second, there will generally be higher levels of DNA variation because of mutations with little or no fitness effect (synonymous variation or intronic variation which tends to have lower selective pressure). \n",
      "To relate this to your last question: even though I would always expect a general amount of variation, even in the amino acid sequence of core enzymes, this variation will probably not be the main reason why you see different phenotypes. Phenotypic plasticity - the differential response of a given genotype to a given environment - is often stronger in plants than in animals as plants are stationary organisms. This plasticity will probably be the main cause of striking phenotypic differences between individuals.\n",

Especially the canine teeth cannot be seen as evidence for prehistoric hunting, as in great apes the size of canine teeth is ridiculously well explained not only by defensive but mostly by mating behaviour; apart from that, humans do not even have those, and that most likely is caused by the trend towards monogamy which reduces inter-male aggression. \n",
      "However, coming back to the actual question, in the relative short history (approx. 200-300ky) of our species there is evidence for 'several transitions towards or away from a vegetarian diet in humans' (Nielsen et al., 2017).\n",
      "And in fact, there even is a human-specific evolutionary derived haplotype (younger than the Human-Neandertal split) that shows signatures of positive selection and is associated with increased efficiency in the synthesis of long chain fatty acid from plant precursor molecules - which would not really be necessary, as these fatty acids are readily available in animal products (Ameur et al., 2012). More specifically, the genes lying on that haplotype belong to the FADS cluster that seemed to have had adaptive value - also for synthesising long chain fatty acids from medium chain plant precursor fatty acids - in African populations even more recently (approx. 85 kya, Mathias et al. 2012).\n",
      "This finding has been supported by a more recent study by Kothapalli et al. (2016). They investigated a 22bp-indel allele in the FADS2 gene that is associated with both higher blood levels of long chain fatty acids and exhibits high frequency (signature of positive selection) especially in South Asia and Africa where there is long tradition for plant-based diet. I would say that there is no feasible way of studying this question. You will find different selective constraints on every single enzyme and breaking this down to DNA this means that every single locus can be target of different selective pressures. And even if you figured out how to answer that question comprehensively for a given species (which probably will not happen), generalising it to every single species in every ecological niche, with every possible population history and so on is close to impossible. That is why one studies sequence diversity/conservation in model organisms and mostly on a per-gene basis.\n",
      "In general, without knowing any background of a species and enzyme, I would however expect two things when looking at molecular variation between individuals of that species. These are merely based on general evolutionary principles and the nature of the genetic code. Keep in mind that these are trends, meaning that many genes will match these expectations but some definitely will not due to lineage-specific evolution.\n",
      "First, I would expect generally high levels of amino acid conservation (but not always identity) especially in functional enzymes of core pathways. However, this depends on the function of the gene product. If the gene is a target of balancing selection, which maintains genetic variation within a population, there can also be considerable amino acid variation.\n",
      "Second, there will generally be higher levels of DNA variation because of mutations with little or no fitness effect (synonymous variation or intronic variation which tends to have lower selective pressure). \n",
      "To relate this to your last question: even though I would always expect a general amount of variation, even in the amino acid sequence of core enzymes, this variation will probably not be the main reason why you see different phenotypes. Phenotypic plasticity - the differential response of a given genotype to a given environment - is often stronger in plants than in animals as plants are stationary organisms. This plasticity will probably be the main cause of striking phenotypic differences between individuals.\n",

      "Open transactions can provide a higher degree of anonymity than Ripple does. With OT, a transaction need only be seen by the sender, recipient, and issuer. And the issuer need not know the identity of either the sender or the recipient at all. With Ripple, transactions are always public so it provides a level of anonymity comparable to Bitcoin.\n",
      "With OT, a specific key owned by a specific entity moderates transfers of each asset. This means the system cannot compel assets to act as they have been promised to act. In contrast, everyone can process all Ripple transactions, so an issuer cannot prevent the system from enforcing their promises.\n",
      "Open transactions doesn't have any support for exchanging between assets without asset holders actively making and enforcing orders. Ripple maintains order books and does path finding to find a payment path between people who use different currencies or different issuers. A Ripple offer is a comittment the system can enforce.\n",
      "This is key to Ripple because it forms an \"invisible hand\" that gives people what they mutually want. For example, say I get paid in dollars but prefer to hold gold. I can place an offer to buy gold. Not only can someone take that offer because they specifically want to sell gold for dollars, but they can take that offer without even realizing it if there's someone else who needs to sell gold and that helps make their payment work. For example, if gold is available cheaply for Euros and they have Euros, they can buy that gold, sell it me for dollars, and use those dollars to buy lunch without even realizing their transaction involved gold.\n",
      "Because the entire system state is public in Ripple, you can always see who has issued what, who holds what, and who trusts what. This allows you to easily form very efficient transactions and to make rational judgments about what to do and who to trust. However, it also means a reduced level of privacy.\n",

      "Another source would be the Simons Genome Diversity Project published by Mallick et al. in 2016. This set covers way more populations than the 1000 Genomes, and therefore includes more overall human genetic diversity, but also has only few individuals per populations (and populations do not overlap with 1000 Genomes as far as I know). \n",
      "Which database is better for you depends on the actual question. In summary, I think the the most parsimonious call is that the bird on your picture is E. citrinella. However, keep in mind that it could also be one of the other species mentioned above, with E. melanocephala - given your size description and the dark head - perhaps being the second most likely identification. It is not always easy to pick cells of one type only (think of trying it with blood, which is a tissue as well). So what you then get is a mixture of different cell types which probably differ in methylation patterns. I am unsure if I really understand the question. Are you wondering how the rate of DNA replication can be slower than the rate of cell division if every daughter cell needs a chromosome copy? \n",
      "If so, keep in mind that prokaryotes have different origins of replication on their chromosome so that DNA replication can actually be parallelised. Cooper (1968) presents a mathematical model that is consistent with experimental findings and indicates that when the DNA replication step becomes limiting for cell division, E. coli switches to multiple replication forks, thus decreasing the net time needed for complete DNA replication.\n",
      "According to that, it is no contradiction that DNA replication per se takes longer than cell division. Finally, how can this be interpreted from an evolutionary point of view? \n",
      "Aside from what was suggested in other answers, you should also try to get to know the state-of-the-art in bioinformatics, i.e. read up on what was done in the last few years, have an open eye for new publications in the field and let you inspire by what other people are/have been working on.\n",

      "To answer question 2: I do not really know what this means, 70% Neandertal DNA in Densiovans. I can just generally tell you something about Densiovan-Neandertal differences. The Densiovan might be the only (at least mammal) species that was defined based on genetic information alone. Alle that was found were a few teeth and a pinky bone. People thought this was another Neandertal. After sequencing the DNA from that bones to high coverage (vaguely, a measure of qualtiy), one found that the DNA falls both outside the variation of modern humans - showing that this was not a Homo sapiens, but interestingly it also clearly falls outside the variation of known Neandertal sequences - showing that this was not a Neandertal. It also became clear that Densiovans are more closely related to Neandertals than to modern humans (you might now ask yourself how this is possible with just one genome. In fact, there are more genetic data availabe: low coverage genomes, exome sequences, mtDNA and all of them show the same thing: Neandertals and Densiovans are different but more closely related to each other than to modern humans). Overall, Denisovans also seem to have had rather low genetic diversity (which by the way is also a characteristic of modern humans).\n",
      "Long story short: There seem to have been admixture events between Denisovans and Neandertals but I do not know how to relate this to the 70%. Prüfer et al. (2014) detected about 0.5% contribution from Neandertals in Denisovans.\n",
      "One last comment about this mysterious species (nobody says it but most people think of Homo erectus): again, Prüfer et al. (2014) found some interesting patterns of derived allele sharing between present-day Africans, Denisovans and Neandertals (this should be equal for African-Denisovan and African-Neandertal comparisons, but present-day Africans share about 7% more derived alleles with Neandertals than with Densiovans - even 13-16% in alleles fixed in present-day Africans). This is either ancient population structure (however, with very deep lineages) or, as suggested in the paper, due to gene flow from a (genetically) unknown archaic hominin into Denisovans. \n",

      "\n",
      "Another source would be the Simons Genome Diversity Project published by Mallick et al. in 2016. This set covers way more populations than the 1000 Genomes, and therefore includes more overall human genetic diversity, but also has only few individuals per populations (and populations do not overlap with 1000 Genomes as far as I know). \n",
      "Which database is better for you depends on the actual question. In summary, I think the the most parsimonious call is that the bird on your picture is E. citrinella. However, keep in mind that it could also be one of the other species mentioned above, with E. melanocephala - given your size description and the dark head - perhaps being the second most likely identification. It is not always easy to pick cells of one type only (think of trying it with blood, which is a tissue as well). So what you then get is a mixture of different cell types which probably differ in methylation patterns. I am unsure if I really understand the question. Are you wondering how the rate of DNA replication can be slower than the rate of cell division if every daughter cell needs a chromosome copy? \n",
      "If so, keep in mind that prokaryotes have different origins of replication on their chromosome so that DNA replication can actually be parallelised. Cooper (1968) presents a mathematical model that is consistent with experimental findings and indicates that when the DNA replication step becomes limiting for cell division, E. coli switches to multiple replication forks, thus decreasing the net time needed for complete DNA replication.\n",
      "According to that, it is no contradiction that DNA replication per se takes longer than cell division. Finally, how can this be interpreted from an evolutionary point of view? \n",
      "Aside from what was suggested in other answers, you should also try to get to know the state-of-the-art in bioinformatics, i.e. read up on what was done in the last few years, have an open eye for new publications in the field and let you inspire by what other people are/have been working on.\n",

      "Indeed I was thinking too linearly.  If we change standard notation slightly, and call $r_3(n)$ the number of (unordered) representations of $n$ as a sum of three increasing and distinct squares, then a sphere with squared radius of $n$ and centered at the origin has at least $48r_3(n)$ integer lattice points on it.  One also has contributions when two of the three squares are equal, or one or more of the squares is zero.

The advancement with Nokia's PureView is that its been scaled down to a level as of yet unheard of, allowing OIS in a phone camera. The sensor, again, is nothing really \"new\". It is a backside illuminated (backilluminated, or BSI) sensor. This allows pixel area to increase relative to the size of other sensors with similar megapixels, improving low-light sensitivity, SNR, etc. BSI sensors are not new...the technology has been known for some time, and BSI sensors have been manufactured for small cameras including phone cameras for a couple years or so now. I am not sure I've seen an 8.7mp BSI phone sensor before, so the advancement here would simply be the number of megapixels packed into a phone. I do not believe the PureView camera uses \"interpolation\", as you put it...its actually hardware pixel bucketing, where the signal from multiple hardware level pixels are read out and combined to produce a single output pixel in the final jpeg image. Hardware level interpolation is more effective than software interpolation, and can produce better IQ overall as the algorithm is working with native, original signal at its maximum definition. \n",

The PureView camera in the Lumia 920 does not have to contend with a wide range of aperture settings, camera bodies, etc., so while it may perform superbly for the limited sensor and apertures of the camera in the Lumia 920...technologically and capably it is highly doubtful it rivals what is possible with a still or video DSLR in any respect.\n",

Different technologies for different purposes. I commend Nokia for adding OIS...even if it doesn't work as well as they claim, it will definitely help bring phone cameras into the realm of actual usability...think how many very blurry, motion blurred, and out of focus shots you see online taken with cell phone cameras that don't have fast enough apertures, sensitive enough sensors, or any kind of image stabilization to speak of.

If you have fully weather sealed gear and never changed the lens while outdoors, you might find some condensation built up on the exterior, and dissipate as it warms. If you do not have fully weather sealed gear, then you should probably take some precautions to minimize condensation. Whenever I do any photography out in a cool humid environment or freezing temperatures, I try to bring my gear inside in stages, as I do not have fully sealed gear. I first make sure its all packed up in my camera pack, and leave it in a garage for a while (where the temperature is usually warmer than the freezing outdoors, but not as warm as my house.) I'll eventually move my gear indoors, where I leave it in my camera bag. I have several packets of silica in my camera bag, which helps to wick up any moisture brought in with my camera gear. \n",

      "Generally speaking, condensation problems only manifest when moving your gear from/to a nice, warm interior to/from the cold outdoors. Once outside, once your gear has adjusted to the temperature, the concern is not nearly as great. The 7D is a professional grade camera, and as such is fully weather resistant. So long as you use professional grade lenses that are also weather sealed, and do not change your lenses while outdoors, you shouldn't have any problems with condensation building up inside your camera.

      "You are classifying particles by representations of the Poincaré group. A one particle state has to be transformed under an element of this group. Part of this transformation just changes the momentum, the other part makes a particle-specific 'intrinsic' transformation of the state (i.e. rotates the spinor indices). Spin and helicity characterize the latter part and in this sense are rather similar.\n",
      "It happens so that this intrinsic transformation can be understood in terms of what is called the small group. For any momentum $p_\\mu$ you can go to a standard reference frame where we will have a standard momentum $k_\\mu$ which lies in the same orbit of the Lorenz group as $p$. For example (I am usign signature $+---$), for massive particles, where you have $p^2=M^2$, you can choose the rest frame, and the standard $k_\\mu=(M,0,0,0)$.  For $p^2=0$ you can go to a reference frame where the momentum becomes $k^\\mu=(\\kappa,0,0,\\kappa)$.\n",
      "Now the small group is the subgroup of the Lorenz group which leaves your standard $k$ invariant. It happens (and for proof of this it is better to read Weinberg, Wigner, etc)  that for every Lorenz transformation there is a corresponding element of the small group that determines the 'intrinsic' transformation.\n",
      "Lets talk about the massive case first. We have $k^\\mu=(M,0,0,0)$, and the small group is clearly just the rotations $SO(3)$. Irreducible representations of this group are well-known and they are parametrized by spin $s$ which can be integer of half-integer. (Formally, the latter are projective representations, but in QM a phase does not matter.) We can also pick an axis and look at the rotation generator $J_3$, and its eigenvalues, this is the 'spin projection'. As far as we have other rotations at our disposal, we can rotate the particle to change this projection. This is the intuitive reason why we have all spin projections between $-s$ and $s$ (with integer steps).\n",
      "Now, what is different in the case of massless particles. The standard momentum is $k^\\mu=(\\kappa,0,0,\\kappa)$ that is a, say, photon travelling along $z$ direction. Now we still have our $J_3$ rotation, but there is some problem with $J_1$ and $J_2$ -- they will change our vector. However, it is possible to save the situation by adding some boosts to these generators. This fact changes the group in this case, and it becomes isomorphic to $ISO(2)$ -- the group of isometries of 2D euclidian plane. In practical terms, we how have three generators in the small group -- $A,B,J_3$, where $A,B$ is what is left of $J_1$ and $J_2$ and correspond to translations of this plane, while $J_3$ is the rotation along the momentum direction and corresponds to rotations in the plane. Of course, this plane picture is just a mathematical abstraction.\n",
      "It is more or less obvious that $A,B$ correspond to some 2D momentum, and so if they have a non-zero eigenvalue, they have continious spectrum (just rotate it with $J_3$). We do not observe any intrinsic continious degrees of freedom for massless patricles, so we conclude that $A,B$ have zero eigenvalues in the representations of interest. We now only have to think about $J_3$ eigenvalue, which is the projection of spin to the momentum direction. Here I say 'spin projection' because it determines the transformation of wavefunction under rotations around some axis. However, this eigenvalue is actually called helicity. For now, no restrictions on its value.\n",
      "You can see that in the masseless case, the relevant irreducible representation of the Lorenz algebra is in fact one-dimensional (just one state with $A\\psi=B\\psi=0$, $J_3\\psi=\\lambda\\psi$) and is parametrized by some parameter $\\lambda$. Now, it is the topology of the Lorenz group that requires $\\lambda$ to be integer or half-integer (in massive case, this requirement grows already from the algebra). Still, no requirements like \"there should be also at least $-\\lambda$\" etc. \n",
      "The physical reason for this is that in massive case, if we knew 'helicity' - the projection of spin to the momentum direction, we could go to the rest frame, rotate the spin as we want, and go back, thus changing the projection. In massless case, there is no rest frame -- when we try to rotate the 'spin', the momentum rotates as well. The helicity is Lorenz-invariant.\n",
      "Why we have, as you say, '$\\pm s_{max}$' in massless case, it is because spatial inversion changes the sign of helicity. So, for particles that 'respect $P$-inversion' we have also particles with opposite sign of helicity, and call them the same names. For neutrino (assume them massless), however, we dont have such a nice thing, so there are neutrinos and antinetrinos with different helicities.\n",

      "Every writer I know constantly fights with the self-doubt of \"not being cut for it\", but to find out you only need to try, try and see what happens. I see that the 3 Act structure can be applied over almost any story, from Hamlet to Mulholland Drive, from The Matrix to Rocky. Story structures like 3 Acts, or 4-5 Acts, always feature a Character Arc and a series of plot turns (i.e. Turning Points) which make the story move on, proceeding from inciting incident, to temporary success, to climax and finale.\n",
      "But I find it hard to detect these elements in movies like Pulp Fiction, Shimmer Lake, Memento, which proceeds back and forth in narration, and thus seem to elude the typical steps of a story. For example, how can something be an inciting incident if it's shown at the end of a movie? How can it be a climax of the hero's journey, if it is shown at the beginning?\n",
      "The question is: how can you insert the Plot Key Points in a story which is not narrated linearly?\n",

Multiplication of two numbers in the same RNS base is simply pointwise modulo multiplication of the two numbers (this can be approximately linear time). However, overflow detection is difficult (it is difficult with addition as well). Multiplication seems much simpler, but parity and magnitude comparison of two numbers seems much more difficult. Magnitude comparison is simply determining which of two numbers is greater, $X \\stackrel{?}{<} Y$, given only their RNS form with the same RNS bases. Parity is simply deciding if a number, $X={\\left(x_1, ~...~, x_k\\right)}_{RNS\\left(m_1, ~...~, m_k\\right)}$ is even or odd (obviously, $X$ is not given, only its RNS form). An interesting thing is that magnitude comparison and parity are related: If you were able to compute parity, then you can do comparison. To do comparison with parity, you do $(X - Y)$ (in RNS), and if it underflows, the parity will be unexpected. That is, normally, assuming $p(X) = X \\mod 2, ~~~ p(X) \\in \\{0,1\\}$ is the parity function, $p(X-Y) \\equiv p(X) + p(Y) \\mod 2$. However, if it underflows, it will wrap around to $M-1$.

      "Each frame has to be deterministic. (think about what should happen when you go backwards in time or skip some frames during playback, or render the frames in different order, ...). \n",
      "There is a Trail Count property in Blenders particle system settings, maybe you can use this (in the Render panel)? How to select 2 random vertices from a list of vertices? Open the node editor, insert a Object ID Key node, click Choose Key and select Initial Transformation. Now you can get the initial location, rotation, etc of the object you have as input. The Initial Transformation of an object does not change unless you press that button again. When  is executed everything looks normal and the console output will be 0. Now imagine you change  so that it returns 1. After this change the reloading order is important.\n",
      "There are two different scenarios: Based on that you can easily create more splines and control them with the planes. Maybe you also want to control the length of the normal with the area of the polygon by using it as scale factor. Another idea is to use the shrinkwrap modifier to position the planes directly on a target object. \n",
      "That number shows how long the last execution of your node tree took.\n",

      "Generally it is not a good idea to store the state of a node in Animation Nodes. The execution of a node should not depend on the executions before. This is also important because nearly all nodes have to work inside of loops - so they can be executed many times with different input in the same node tree execution.\n",
      "Beside that I agree that it is sometimes useful to store some information (cache data etc.) which cannot be stored in Blenders properties (bpy.props). You cannot use the python dictionary of a node as you noticed. However, it is possible to create a dictionary in the module (file) that contains the node. You can use the identifier of a node (myNode.identifier) as key in the dict. Animation Nodes ensures that each identifier only exists once. The disadvantage of this approach is that the data will not be stored in the .blend file. For eg caching that is no problem though. \n",
      "This is a 'problem' that is caused by Blender. Animation Nodes (or other addons) cannot change this behavior. Personally I don't care that I can't use the instance dictionary. Maybe it is even better the way it is because so we cannot confuse the data that is stored in the .blend file and other variables.   and then :\n",

Sometimes it helps to reload twice to make sure that all modules use the updated functions. There is still a good chance that two modules which depend on the same module will have different versions of the same function but in most cases you don't need to care about that.\n",
      "Currently there is only one module in AN that needs to be reloaded before all the others: $URL$\n",

      "Reloading should definitly work when you only changed a single file. Maybe you have to reload twice (I hit F8 twice all the time..).\n",

      "\n",
      "The easiest way to do this is to use the Transform Vector node like so: As you noticed yourself the list that will contain the elements depends on the frames before -> thus is it Simulation, and this is not supported by Animation Nodes. \n",
      "Each frame has to be deterministic. (think about what should happen when you go backwards in time or skip some frames during playback, or render the frames in different order, ...). \n",
      "There is a Trail Count property in Blenders particle system settings, maybe you can use this (in the Render panel)? How to select 2 random vertices from a list of vertices? Open the node editor, insert a Object ID Key node, click Choose Key and select Initial Transformation. Now you can get the initial location, rotation, etc of the object you have as input. The Initial Transformation of an object does not change unless you press that button again. When  is executed everything looks normal and the console output will be 0. Now imagine you change  so that it returns 1. After this change the reloading order is important.\n",
      "There are two different scenarios: Based on that you can easily create more splines and control them with the planes. Maybe you also want to control the length of the normal with the area of the polygon by using it as scale factor. Another idea is to use the shrinkwrap modifier to position the planes directly on a target object. \n",
      "That number shows how long the last execution of your node tree took.\n",
      "It changes all the time because by default Auto Execution is enabled. If you don't want that you can disable auto execution in the corresponding panel.\n",
      "It is turned on by default because it makes it easier to get started. \n",
      "You should be able to do it like so: Search Box: Ctrl + A\n",
      "Pie Menu: W (when the Object Instancer node is active) \n",
      "Generally it is not a good idea to store the state of a node in Animation Nodes. The execution of a node should not depend on the executions before. This is also important because nearly all nodes have to work inside of loops - so they can be executed many times with different input in the same node tree execution.\n",
      "Beside that I agree that it is sometimes useful to store some information (cache data etc.) which cannot be stored in Blenders properties (bpy.props). You cannot use the python dictionary of a node as you noticed. However, it is possible to create a dictionary in the module (file) that contains the node. You can use the identifier of a node (myNode.identifier) as key in the dict. Animation Nodes ensures that each identifier only exists once. The disadvantage of this approach is that the data will not be stored in the .blend file. For eg caching that is no problem though. \n",
      "This is a 'problem' that is caused by Blender. Animation Nodes (or other addons) cannot change this behavior. Personally I don't care that I can't use the instance dictionary. Maybe it is even better the way it is because so we cannot confuse the data that is stored in the .blend file and other variables.   and then :\n",
      "In this case everything works as expected,  will be updated at first, then the updated function is imported into  and the output will be 1.\n",
      " and then :\n",
      "Now  imports the old function again (the one that returns 0) because  has not been reloaded yet. Then output will still be 0. In general you can simply try to reload all addons by hitting F8. Sometimes it helps to reload twice to make sure that all modules use the updated functions. There is still a good chance that two modules which depend on the same module will have different versions of the same function but in most cases you don't need to care about that.\n",
      "Currently there is only one module in AN that needs to be reloa ded before all the others: $URL$\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "Reloading should definitly work when you only changed a single file. Maybe you have to reload twice (I hit F8 twice all the time..).\n",
      "Reloading does not work (only if you are lucky) when you added/removed a function from a module that is imported into other modules.\n",
      "Most of the time I just try it and when it doesn't work I restart Blender. Take a look into the console if any exception is raised (also note that not all exceptions have to come from AN; other actived addons might not support reloading) \n",
      "Most of the time you can simply copy the output of Animation Nodes in the viewport and continue to work on that copy. The node tree that created the object can be deactivated. Make the shoot a ray in a random direction and calculate the angle between the normal and the ray direction. \n",

      "As Matt Grum has stated, you'll want to maximize exposure value (EV), but using the longest exposure at the widest aperture you can. Generally speaking, shorter focal lengths support longer exposure times, and when your goal is wide-field photography, focal lengths of 16mm or less are great (so your 10-22 @ 10mm-16mm will be an ideal lens.) To determine the exposure time you'll need to avoid star trails, you can use the \"Rule of 600\". This simply states: \n",
      "The Canon 600D uses a mechanical shutter, and it does indeed go up to 1/4000th rate. There is no \"electronic\" shutter in Canon DSLR's that I know of. You pretty much nailed it on the head with your 'ps'...the two shutter curtains race over the sensor with a tiny slit (see 'Focal plane shutter, high speed' figure), with the second curtain a minuscule fraction of a second behind the first curtain.\n",
      "As for maximum speed, I can't say for sure, but pretty high. There are many DSLR cameras that have a 1/8000th or 1/10000th shutter rate, usually \"pro grade\" models. The high maximum speed of this type of shutter is one of its strengths (leaf shutters, for example, tend to be limited to about 1/500th.) \n",
      "The glare effect on the monitor itself is a digitized effect, it is not real. Technically speaking, it is near impossible to get a clear photograph of a computer screen with the image it is displaying like you can see in that Apple example. What is generally done is a photograph of the screen(s) are taken while they are off, and the images that are supposedly being displayed on the screens, as well as the highlights, are added using Photoshop.\n",
      "It may be possible to get something similar to that using a very carefully crafted lighting setup, however it is highly doubtful that you would ever get such a clean highlight with such a crisp edge. Highlights in reality are reflections (usually specular) of light sources, so a rectangular light source with just the right shape and brightness would be necessary to generate a highlight like that. \n",
      "I don't do much in the way of still object photography myself, I've only observed it being done. I have, however, done quite a bit of graphic design work, and the effect is a breeze to do using photoshop and a stock photo of a monitor (or monitors) All it really takes is a screen shot of the image you want the monitor to be displaying scaled, skewed, and rotated to fit the screen, and a translucent white gradient drawn at the appropriate angle. The above shot was taken this past November 8th, at about 7pm...a fairly new moon. It was shot with a Canon EOS 450D using the Canon EF 100-400mm L series lens @ 400mm, f/7.1 and ISO 800 for 1/2 of a second. That exposure time was necessary to expose the clouds enough to create a silhouette of the foreground treetops, and not overexpose the moon itself. It was a fairly tricky shot, and in the end part of the crescent did get a little over exposed.\n",
      "Determining which settings to use boiled down to a maybe two things. What I wanted to compose my scene with, and how much time I had to take the shot. At 400mm, the motion of the moon across the sky is heightened quite a bit, and at most you have about 0.8-1 second before that motion blurs detail. I wanted to expose long enough that the clouds obscuring the moon were bright enough to show silhouettes of the tree tops. I also wanted to get some earthshine on the dark part (a desire that was really pushing it...and, I ended up choosing an exposure that was a bit too high in this case, as 1/4-1/6th of a second would have probably been better, or perhaps ISO 400 rather than ISO 800.)\n",
      "There is no single correct set of exposure settings that will always expose the moon correctly. Its luminosity depends on a couple factors, primarily its phase, its position in the sky, and what exactly you want to expose (i.e. just the moon, or the moon with some earthshine.) Here is a table of base exposure for digital cameras, assuming an aperture of f/8, based on some of my experience (note that the difference between each phase is not exactly one stop, the scale tends to get skewed a bit as you reach full moon): Posterization caused by JPEG image compression when over-compressing a JPEG.\n",
      "Posterization caused by low color information in lower signal areas.\n",
      "Quantization caused by high bit depth, wide gamut image information being displayed on a low bit depth computer screen. \n",
      "The base ISO of all Canon cameras is ISO 100. This is the ISO with the lowest gain, without any in-camera magickry to achieve the setting (like ISO 50, which mucks with the actual exposure settings behind the scenes). \n",
      "There is a lot of conjecture and misunderstanding about Canon's ISO settings because they use a \"real/push/pull\" model for ISO settings, rather than using native analog gain for all ISO settings. Canon only uses a standard analog gain (per-pixel amplification) for full stop ISO settings up to a certain high ISO level. So, ISO 100, 200, 400, ..., 3200 are usually achieved by using standard analog signal amplification. After a certain point, really high ISO settings in Canon cameras are achieved via a base analog amp., plus a secondary downstream (post-read/pre-ADC) amp, and possibly a digital boost. \n",
      "For Canon cameras pre-5D III generation (i.e. 5D II, 7D, 50D, 550D, etc.) the highest directly amplified ISO settting is usually 1600, after which a combination of downstream amplification, push/pull, and possibly digital boost is used. For post-5D III generation (i.e. 5D III, 1D X, 6D, 70D, etc.) cameras, the highest directly amplified ISO setting is either 3200 or 6400, with the possibility that rebels still top out at ISO 1600.\n",
      "Finally, third-stop ISO settings are achieved by using a 1/3rd stop \"push\" or \"pull\" using a downstream amplifier after read. ISO 125 is a third-stop \"push\" of ISO 100, where as ISO 160 is a third-stop \"pull\" of ISO 200. ISO 250 is a third-stop \"push\" of ISO 200, where as ISO 320 is a third-stop \"pull\" of ISO 400. This is why the 2/3rds stop ISO settings in Canon cameras are a little cleaner...the \"pull\" shoves the noise floor down a little bit. \n",
      "The use of push/pull does not make ISO 160, 320, or 640 the \"base\" ISO...that is an internet myth, breed by conjecture, misunderstanding, and a simple lack of real knowledge of how Canon achieves the necessary signal boost for each ISO setting. All Canon cameras (with the exception of some of the earliest models) use ISO 100 as base ISO.\n",
      "It should be noted that Base ISO is different than Unity ISO. Unity ISO is the ISO setting where gain is one, or in other words for every electron of charge, the ADC converts one DU (digital unit). It is pretty rare that Unity ISO is actually selectable, however there is usually a close third-stop setting to unity. What Unity ISO is depends on the camera, the sensor, the full-well capacity, and other factors (Roger Clark has lots of information on his site for popular Canon camera models, and within them he usually derives unity gain, if knowing it is important (some applications may benefit from unity gain).) \n",
